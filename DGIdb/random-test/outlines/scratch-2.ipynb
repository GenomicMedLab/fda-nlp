Four of these were 6-week trials in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depression: two involving dose titration with venlafaxine hydrochloride in a range of 75 to 225 mg/day (t.i.d. schedule), the third involving fixed venlafaxine hydrochloride doses of 75, 225, and 375 mg/day (t.i.d. schedule), and the fourth involving doses of 25, 75, and 200 mg/day (b.i.d. schedule). The fifth was a 4-week study of adult inpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depression with melancholia whose venlafaxine hydrochloride doses were titrated in a range of 150 to 375 mg/day (t.i.d. schedule). In these 5 studies, venlafaxine hydrochloride was shown to be significantly superior to placebo on at least 2 of the following 3 measures: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (total score), Hamilton depressed mood item, and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness rating. Doses from 75 to 225 mg/day were superior to placebo in outpatient studies and a mean dose of about 350 mg/day was effective in inpatients. Data from the 2 fixed-dose outpatient studies were suggestive of a dose-response relationship in the range of 75 to 225 mg/day. There was no suggestion of increased response with doses greater than 225 mg/day. While there were no efficacy studies focusing specifically on an elderly population, elderly patients were included among the patients studied. Overall, approximately 2/3 of all patients in these trials were women. Exploratory analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex. In one longer-term study, adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an 8-week open trial on venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (75, 150, or 225 mg, qAM) were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule dose or to placebo, for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≤3 and a HAM-D-21 total score of ≤10 at the day 56 evaluation. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as follows: (1) a reappearance of major depressive disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria and a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥4 (moderately ill), (2) 2 consecutive CGI Severity of Illness item scores of ≥4, or (3) a final CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥4 for any patient who withdrew from the study for any reason. Patients receiving continued venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 26 weeks compared with those receiving placebo. In a second longer-term trial, adult outpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depression, recurrent type, who had responded (HAM-D-21 total score ≤12 at the day 56 evaluation) and continued to be improved [defined as the following criteria being met for days 56 through 180: (1) no HAM-D-21 total score ≥20; (2) no more than 2 HAM-D-21 total scores >10; and (3) no single CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥4 (moderately ill)] during an initial 26 weeks of treatment on venlafaxine hydrochloride (100 to 200 mg/day, on a b.i.d. schedule) were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine hydrochloride dose or to placebo. The follow-up period to observe patients for relapse, defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥4, was for up to 52 weeks. Patients receiving continued venlafaxine hydrochloride treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 52 weeks compared with those receiving placebo.\\nRESULT: ',\n",

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): 3 short-term trials in adults (Studies GAD-1, GAD-2, and GAD-3), 1 maintenance trial in adults (Study GAD-4), 1 short-term trial in geriatric patients (Study GAD-5), and 1 short-term trial in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age (Study GAD-6) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP): Two 12-week trials in adults (Studies DPNP-1 and DPNP-2) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Fibromyalgia (FM): Two trials in adults (one of 3 months duration and one of 6 months duration) (Studies FM-1 and FM-2) and one 13-week trial in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age (Study FM-4) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: Two 12- to 13-week trials in adult patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) (Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-3) and one 13-week trial in adult patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) (Study OA-1) [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. Additionally, a summary of the following trials that did not demonstrate efficacy are presented below: Study FM-3 (a 16-week trial in adult patients with fibromyalgia), Study CLBP-2 (a 13-week trial in adult patients with CLBP), and Study OA-2 (a 13-week trial in adult patients with chronic pain due to OA). 14.2 Major Depressive Disorder in Adults The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules as a treatment for MDD in adults was established in 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, fixed-dose trials in adult outpatients (18 to 83 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD: In Studies MDD-1 and MDD-2, patients were randomized to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily (N=123 and N=128, respectively) or placebo (N=122 and N=139, respectively) for 9 weeks In Study MDD-3, patients were randomized to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 or 40 mg twice daily (N=86 and N=91, respectively) or placebo (N=89) for 8 weeks In Study MDD-4, patients were randomized to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 40 or 60 mg twice daily (N=95 and N=93, respectively) or placebo (N=93) for 8 weeks. In all four trials, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) total score (see Table 8 ). There is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefits. In all of these clinical trials, analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

Two hundred and seventy-eight patients who responded to open label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 10 and 12: a HAMD-17 total score ≤9, Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) ≤2, and not meeting the DSM-IV criteria for MDD] were randomly assigned to continuation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same dosage (N=136) or to placebo (N=142) for 6 months. In Study MDD-5, patients on duloxetine experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of depression than did patients on placebo (see Figure 1 ). Relapse was defined as an increase in the CGI-S score of ≥2 points compared with that obtained at week 12, as well as meeting the DSM-IV criteria for MDD at 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart, where the 2-week temporal criterion had to be satisfied at only the second visit. Figure 1: Cumulative Proportion Kaplan-Meier estimator method of Adult Patients with MDD Relapse (Study MDD-5) 14.3 Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD Trials in Adults (Including Geriatric Patients) The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established in 1 fixed-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and 2 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients between 18 and 83 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Studies GAD-1, GAD-2, and GAD-3, respectively). In Studies GAD-1 and GAD-2, the starting dose was 60 mg once daily (down titration to 30 mg once daily was allowed for tolerability reasons; the dosage could be increased to 60 mg once daily). Fifteen percent of patients were down titrated. Study GAD-3 had a starting dose of 30 mg once daily for 1 week before increasing it to 60 mg once daily. Studies GAD-2 and GAD-3 involved dose titration with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules doses ranging from 60 mg once daily to 120 mg once daily (N=168 and N=162) compared to placebo (N=159 and N=161) over a 10-week treatment period. The mean dosage for completers at endpoint in these trials was 104.8 mg/day. Study GAD-1 evaluated Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of 60 mg once daily (N=168) and 120 mg once daily (N=170) compared to placebo (N=175) over a 9-week treatment period. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit. In all 3 trials, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score (see Table 9 ) and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score. The SDS is a composite measurement of the extent emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in 3 life domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities. In Study GAD-4, 887 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD received Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg to 120 mg once daily during an initial 26-week open-label treatment phase. Four hundred and twenty-nine patients who responded to open- label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 24 and 26: a decrease from baseline HAM-A total score by at least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and a Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) score of 1 or 2] were randomly assigned to continuation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same dosage (N=216) or to placebo (N=213) and were observed for relapse. Of the patients randomized, 73% had been in a responder status for at least 10 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score at least 2 points to a score ≥4 and a MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) diagnosis of GAD (excluding duration), or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of GAD than did patients taking placebo (see Figure 2 ). Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. GAD Trial in Geriatric Patients The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of patients ≥65 years of age with GAD was established in one 10-week flexible-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults ≥65 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Study GAD-5). In Study GAD-5, the starting dose was 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks before further dose increases in 30 mg increments at treatment weeks 2, 4, and 7 up to 120 mg once daily were allowed based on investigator judgment of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dosage for patients completing the 10-week acute treatment phase was 51 mg. Patients treated with duloxetine (N=151) demonstrated significantly greater improvement compared with placebo (N=140) on mean change from baseline to endpoint as measured by the HAM-A total score (see Table 9 ). GAD Trial in Pediatric Patients 7 to 17 Years Old The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with GAD was established in 1 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric outpatients with GAD (based on DSM-IV criteria) (Study GAD-6). In Study GAD-6, the starting dosage was 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Further dosage increases in 30 mg increments up to 120 mg once daily were allowed based on investigator judgment of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dosage for patients completing the 10-week treatment phase was 57.6 mg/day. In this study, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (N=135) demonstrated superiority over placebo (N=137) from baseline to endpoint as measured by greater improvement in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) for GAD severity score (see Table 9 ).

These trials enrolled a total of 791 patients of whom 592 (75%) completed the trials. Patients enrolled had Type I or II diabetes mellitus with a diagnosis of painful distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy for at least 6 months. The patients had a baseline pain score of ≥4 on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Patients were permitted up to 4 grams of acetaminophen per day as needed for pain, in addition to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Patients recorded their pain daily in a diary. Both trials compared Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily or 60 mg twice daily with placebo. Study DPNP-1 additionally compared Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 mg with placebo. A total of 457 patients (342 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 115 placebo) were enrolled in Study DPNP-1 and a total of 334 patients (226 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 108 placebo) were enrolled in Study DPNP-2. Treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg one or two times a day statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain scores from baseline and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain scores from baseline. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 3 and 4 show the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Studies DPNP-1 and DPNP-2, respectively. The figures are cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the trial. Figure 3: Percentage of DPNP Adult Patients Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief as Measured by 24-Hour Average Pain Severity (Study DPNP-1) Figure 4: Percentage of DPNP Adult Patients Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief as Measured by 24-Hour Average Pain Severity (Study DPNP-2) 14.5 Fibromyalgia Adult Trials in Fibromyalgia The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the management of fibromyalgia in adults was established in two randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials in adult patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia (a history of widespread pain for 3 months, and pain present at 11 or more of the 18 specific tender point sites). Study FM-1 was three months in duration and enrolled female patients only. Study FM-2 was six months in duration and enrolled male and female patients. Approximately 25% of participants had a comorbid diagnosis of MDD. Studies FM-1 and FM-2 enrolled a total of 874 patients of whom 541 (62%) completed the trials. A total of 354 patients (234 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 120 placebo) were enrolled in Study FM-1 and a total of 520 patients (376 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 144 placebo) were enrolled in Study FM-2 (5% male, 95% female). The patients had a baseline pain score of 6.5 on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse possible pain). Studies FM-1 and FM-2 compared Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily or 120 mg daily (given in divided doses in Study FM-1 and as a single daily dose in Study FM-2) with placebo. Study FM-2 additionally compared Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 mg with placebo during the initial three months of a six-month trial. Treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg or 120 mg daily statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain scores from baseline and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain score from baseline. Pain reduction was observed in patients both with and without comorbid MDD. However, the degree of pain reduction may be greater in patients with comorbid MDD. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 5 and 6 show the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Studies FM-1 and FM-2, respectively. The figures are cumulative so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the trial. Improvement was also demonstrated on measures of function (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaires) and patient global impression of change (PGI). Neither trial demonstrated a benefit of 120 mg compared to 60 mg, and a higher dosage was associated with more adverse reactions and premature discontinuations of treatment. Figure 5: Percentage of Adult Fibromyalgia Patients Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief at Study Endpoint as Measured by 24-Hour Average Pain Severity (Study FM-1) Figure 6: Percentage of Adult Fibromyalgia Patients Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief at Study Endpoint as Measured by 24-Hour Average Pain Severity (Study FM-2) Additionally, the benefit of up-titration in non-responders to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at 60 mg/day was evaluated in a separate trial (Study FM-3). Adult patients were initially treated with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily for eight weeks in open-label fashion. Subsequently, completers of this phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at either 60 mg once daily or 120 mg once daily. Responders were defined as patients who had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from baseline at the end of the 8-week treatment. Patients who were non-responders at 8 weeks were no more likely to meet response criteria at the end of 60 weeks of treatment if blindly titrated to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 120 mg as compared to those who were blindly continued on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg. Pediatric Trial in Fibromyalgia Duloxetine delayed-release capsules were studied in 184 pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years with juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome in a 13-week, placebo-controlled trial (Study FM-4). In Study FM-4, 149 (81%) patients completed the trial. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (N=91) were initiated at a dosage of 30 mg once daily for one week and titrated to 60 mg once daily for 12 weeks, as tolerated. The mean dosage for patients completing the 12-week treatment phase was 49 mg/day. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules showed improvement over placebo on the primary endpoint [change from baseline to end-of-treatment on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) – Modified Short Form: Adolescent Version 24-hour average pain severity rating] with a p-value of 0.052 from the pre- specified primary analysis, and p-values ranging from 0.011-0.020 from sensitivity analyses which assigned baseline values to missing assessments of some patients who did not complete the trial for various reasons. The patients had a baseline BPI of 5.7. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 7 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Study FM-4. Figure 7: Percentage of Pediatric Patients Aged 13 to 17 Years Old with Juvenile Fibromyalgia Syndrome Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief at Week 12 (Study FM-4) a 14.6 Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in Adults Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults. This has been established in trials in adult patients with chronic low back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis. Trials in Chronic Low Back Pain in Adults The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in chronic low back pain (CLBP) in adults was assessed in two double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized clinical trials of 13-weeks duration (Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-2), and one of 12-weeks duration (CLBP-3). Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-3 demonstrated efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of CLBP. Patients in all trials had no signs of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis. Study CLBP-1: Two hundred thirty-six adult patients (N=115 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=121 on placebo) enrolled and 182 (77%) completed 13-week treatment phase. After 7 weeks of treatment, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients with less than 30% reduction in average daily pain and who were able to tolerate 60 mg once daily had their Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosage, in a double- blinded fashion, increased to 120 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60-120 mg daily had a significantly greater pain reduction compared to patients taking placebo. Randomization was stratified by the patients\\' baseline NSAIDs use status. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were differences in treatment outcomes as a function of NSAIDs use. Study CLBP-2: Four hundred and four patients were randomized to receive fixed dosages of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules daily or a matching placebo (N=59 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 mg, N=116 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg, N=112 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 120 mg, N=117 on placebo) and 267 (66%) completed the entire 13-week trial. After 13 weeks of treatment, none of the three Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages showed a statistically significant difference in pain reduction compared to placebo. Study CLBP-3: Four hundred and one patients were randomized to receive fixed doses of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg daily or placebo (N=198 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=203 on placebo), and 303 (76%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 12 weeks of treatment, patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg daily had significantly greater pain reduction compared to patients taking placebo. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 8 and 9 show the fraction of patients in Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-3 achieving that degree of improvement, respectively. The figures are cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned the value of 0% improvement.

All patients in both trials fulfilled the ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for classification of idiopathic OA of the knee. Randomization was stratified by the patients\\' baseline NSAIDs-use status. Patients assigned to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules started treatment in both trials at a dose of 30 mg once daily for one week. After the first week, the dose of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules was increased to 60 mg once daily. After 7 weeks of treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily, in Study OA-1 patients with sub-optimal response to treatment (<30% pain reduction) and tolerated Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily had their dose increased to 120 mg. However, in Study OA-2, all patients, regardless of their response to treatment after 7 weeks, were re-randomized to either continue receiving Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily or have their dosage increased to 120 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial. Patients in the placebo treatment groups in both trials received a matching placebo for the entire duration of trials. For both trials, efficacy analyses were conducted using 13-week data from the combined Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg and 120 mg once daily treatment groups compared to the placebo group. Study OA-1: Two hundred fifty-six patients (N=128 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=128 on placebo) enrolled and 204 (80%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules had significantly greater pain reduction than patients taking placebo. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were differences in treatment outcomes as a function of NSAIDs use. Study OA-2: Two hundred thirty-one patients (N=111 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=120 on placebo) enrolled and 173 (75%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules did not show a significantly greater pain reduction than patients taking placebo. In Study OA-1, for various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 10 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned the value of 0% improvement.
