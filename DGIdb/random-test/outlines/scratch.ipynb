       "'14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tramadol hydrochloride tablets have been given in single oral doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg to patients with pain following surgical procedures and pain following oral surgery (extraction of impacted molars). In single-dose models of pain following oral surgery, pain relief was demonstrated in some patients at doses of 50 mg and 75 mg. A dose of 100 mg tramadol hydrochloride tablets tended to provide analgesia superior to codeine sulfate 60 mg, but it was not as effective as the combination of aspirin 650 mg with codeine phosphate 60 mg. Tramadol hydrochloride tablets have been studied in three long-term controlled trials involving a total of 820 patients, with 530 patients receiving tramadol hydrochloride tablets. Patients with a variety of chronic painful conditions were studied in double-blind trials of one to three months duration. Average daily doses of approximately 250 mg of tramadol hydrochloride tablets in divided doses were generally comparable to five doses of acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg (TYLENOL with Codeine #3) daily, five doses of aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg daily, or two to three doses of acetaminophen 500 mg with oxycodone hydrochloride 5 mg (TYLOX) daily. Titration Trials In a randomized, blinded clinical study with 129 to 132 patients per group, a 10-day titration to a daily tramadol hydrochloride tablets dose of 200 mg (50 mg four times per day), attained in 50 mg increments every 3 days, was found to result in fewer discontinuations due to dizziness or vertigo than titration over only 4 days or no titration. In a second study with 54 to 59 patients per group, patients who had nausea or vomiting when titrated over 4 days were randomized to re-initiate tramadol hydrochloride tablets therapy using slower titration rates.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Parkinson's Disease The effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of 11 randomized, controlled trials. Four trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinson’s disease and no concomitant L-dopa and seven trials were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease with concomitant L-dopa. Three placebo-controlled trials provide evidence of effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the management of patients with Parkinson’s disease who were and were not receiving concomitant L-dopa. Two of these three trials enrolled patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) and one enrolled patients receiving L-dopa. In these trials a variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g., the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scores, patient diaries recording time “on” and “off,” tolerability of L-dopa dose reductions). In both trials of patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa), the motor component (Part III) of the UPDRS was the primary outcome assessment. The UPDRS is a multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor performance (Part III), and complications of therapy (Part IV). Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 items designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinson’s disease (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) scored for different body regions and has a maximum (worst) score of 108. In the trial of patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (with L-dopa), both reduction in percent awake time spent “off” and the ability to reduce the daily use of L-dopa were assessed as a combined endpoint and individually. Trials in Patients with Early Parkinson’s Disease (without L-dopa) Trial 1 was a 12-week multicenter trial in which 63 patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease receiving concomitant anti-Parkinson medication (but not L-dopa) were enrolled and 41 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 22 to placebo. Patients had a mean disease duration of approximately 2 years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented with bradykinesia and at least tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. In addition, they must have been classified as Hoehn & Yahr Stage I-IV. This scale, ranging from I = unilateral involvement with minimal impairment to V = confined to wheelchair or bed, is a standard instrument used for staging patients with Parkinson’s disease. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the proportion of patients experiencing a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 30% in the UPDRS motor score. Patients were titrated for up to 10 weeks, starting at 0.5 mg twice daily, with weekly increments of 0.5 mg twice daily to a maximum of 5 mg twice daily. Once patients reached their maximally tolerated dose (or 5 mg twice daily), they were maintained on that dose through 12 weeks. The mean dose achieved by patients at trial endpoint was 7.4 mg/day. Mean baseline UPDRS motor score was 18.6 for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 19.9 for patients treated with placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 6). Table 6. Percent Responders for UPDRS Motor Score in Trial 1 (Intent-to-Treat Population) % Responders Difference from Placebo Placebo 41% NA ropinirole tablets 71% 30% Trial 2 in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial. In this trial, 241 patients were enrolled and 116 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 125 to placebo. Patients were essentially similar to those in the trial described above; concomitant use of selegiline was allowed, but patients were not permitted to use anticholinergics or amantadine during the trial. Patients had a mean disease duration of 2 years and limited (not more than a 6-week period) or no prior exposure to L-dopa. The starting dosage of ropinirole tablets in this trial was 0.25 mg three times daily. The dosage was titrated at weekly intervals by increments of 0.25 mg three times daily to a dosage of 1 mg three times daily. Further titrations at weekly intervals were at increments of 0.5 mg three times daily up to a dosage of 3 mg three times daily, and then weekly at increments of 1 mg three times daily. Patients were to be titrated to a dosage of at least 1.5 mg three times daily and then to their maximally tolerated dosage, up to a maximum of 8 mg three times daily. The mean dose attained in patients at trial endpoint was 15.7 mg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the mean percent reduction (improvement) from baseline in the UPDRS motor score. At the end of the 6-month trial, patients treated with ropinirole tablets showed improvement in motor score compared with placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 7). Table 7. Mean Percentage Change from Baseline in UPDRS Motor Score at End of Treatment in Trial 2 (Intent-to-Treat Population) Treatment Baseline UPDRS Motor Score Mean Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Placebo 17.7 +4% NA ropinirole tablets 17.9 -22% -26% Trial in Patients with Advanced Parkinson’s Disease (with L-dopa) Trial 3 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial that randomized 149 patients (Hoehn & Yahr II-IV) who were not adequately controlled on L-dopa. Ninety-five patients were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 54 were randomized to placebo. Patients in this trial had a mean disease duration of approximately 9 years, had been exposed to L-dopa for approximately 7 years, and had experienced “on-off” periods with L-dopa therapy. Patients previously receiving stable doses of selegiline, amantadine, and/or anticholinergic agents could continue on these agents during the trial. Patients were started at a dosage of 0.25 mg three times daily of ropinirole tablets and titrated upward by weekly intervals until an optimal therapeutic response was achieved. The maximum dosage of trial medication was 8 mg three times daily. All patients had to be titrated to at least a dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily. Patients could then be maintained on this dosage level or higher for the remainder of the trial. Once a dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily was achieved, patients underwent a mandatory reduction in their L-dopa dosage, to be followed by additional mandatory reductions with continued escalation of the dosage of ropinirole tablets. Reductions in the dosage of L-dopa were also allowed if patients experienced adverse reactions that the investigator considered related to dopaminergic therapy. The mean dose attained at trial endpoint was 16.3 mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who were able both to achieve a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 20% in their L-dopa dosage and a decrease of at least 20% in the proportion of the time awake in the “off” condition (a period of time during the day when patients are particularly immobile), as determined by subject diary. In addition, the mean change in “off” time from baseline and the percent change from baseline in daily L-dopa dosage were examined. At the end of 6 months, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 8). Based on the protocol-mandated reductions in L-dopa dosage with escalating doses of ropinirole tablets, patients treated with ropinirole tablets had a 19.4% mean reduction in L-dopa dosage while patients treated with placebo had a 3% reduction. Mean daily L-dopa dosage at baseline was 759 mg for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 843 mg for patients treated with placebo. The mean number of daily “off” hours at baseline was 6.4 hours for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 7.3 hours for patients treated with placebo. At the end of the 6-month trial, there was a mean reduction of 1.5 hours of “off” time in patients treated with ropinirole tablets and a mean reduction of 0.9 hours of “off” time in patients treated with placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 0.6 hours of “off” time. Table 8. Mean Responder Percentage of Patients Reducing Daily L-Dopa Dosage by at Least 20% and Daily Proportion of “Off” Time by at Least 20% at End of Treatment in Trial 3 (Intent-to-Treat Population) Treatment % Responders Difference from Placebo Placebo 11% NA Ropinirole tablets 28% 17% 14.2 Restless Legs Syndrome The effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Patients were required to have a history of a minimum of 15 RLS episodes/month during the previous month and a total score of ≥15 on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS scale) at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, anemia) were excluded. All trials employed flexible dosing, with patients initiating therapy at 0.25 mg ropinirole tablets once daily. Patients were titrated based on clinical response and tolerability over 7 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg once daily. All doses were taken between 1 and 3 hours before bedtime. A variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment, including the IRLS scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. Three of the controlled trials utilized the change from baseline in the IRLS scale at the Week 12 endpoint as the primary efficacy outcome. Three hundred eighty patients were randomized to receive ropinirole tablets (n = 187) or placebo (n = 193) in a US trial (RLS-1); 284 were randomized to receive either ropinirole tablets (n = 146) or placebo (n = 138) in a multinational trial (excluding US) (RLS-2); and 267 patients were randomized to ropinirole tablets (n = 131) or placebo (n = 136) in a multinational trial (including US) (RLS-3). Across the three trials, the mean duration of RLS was 16 to 22 years (range: 0 to 65 years), mean age was approximately 54 years (range: 18 to 79 years), and approximately 61% were women. The mean dose at Week 12 was approximately 2 mg/day for the three trials. At baseline, mean total IRLS score was 22 for ropinirole tablets and 21.6 for placebo in RLS-1, was 24.4 for ropinirole tablets and 25.2 for placebo in RLS-2, and was 23.6 for ropinirole tablets and 24.8 for placebo in RLS-3. In all three trials, a statistically significant difference between the treatment group receiving ropinirole tablets and the treatment group receiving placebo was observed at Week 12 for both the mean change from baseline in the IRLS scale total score and the percentage of patients rated as responders (much improved or very much improved) on the CGI-I (see Table 9). Table 9. Mean Change in Total IRLS Score and Percent Responders on CGI-I Ropinirole Tablets Placebo Difference from Placebo Mean change in total IRLS score at Week 12 RLS-1 -13.5 -9.8 -3.7 RLS-2 -11.0 -8.0 -3.0 RLS-3 -11.2 -8.7 -2.5 Percent responders on CGI-I at Week 12 RLS-1 73.3% 56.5% 16.8% RLS-2 53.4% 40.9% 12.5% RLS-3 59.5% 39.6% 19.9% Long-term maintenance of efficacy in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in a 36-week trial. Following a 24-week, single-blind treatment phase (flexible dosages of ropinirole tablets of 0.25 to 4 mg once daily), patients who were responders (defined as a decrease of >6 points on the IRLS scale total score relative to baseline) were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or continuation of ropinirole tablets for an additional 12 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase of at least 6 points on the IRLS scale total score to a total score of at least 15, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. For patients who were responders at Week 24, the mean dose of ropinirole tablets were 2 mg (range: 0.25 to 4 mg). Patients continued on ropinirole tablets demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate compared with patients randomized to placebo (32.6% versus 57.8%, P = 0.0156).\n"
