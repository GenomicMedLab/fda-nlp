      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of LUMOXITI was based upon Study 1053 titled “A Pivotal Multicenter Trial of Moxetumomab Pasudotox in Relapsed/Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia” (NCT01829711). Study 1053 was conducted in patients with histologically confirmed HCL or HCL variant with a need for therapy based on presence of cytopenias or splenomegaly and who had received prior treatment with at least 2 systemic therapies, including 1 purine nucleoside analog (PNA). Eligible patients had serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min as estimated by the Cockcroft Gault equation. A total of 80 patients were enrolled; 77 with classic HCL and 3 with HCL variant. The median age was 60 years (range: 34 to 84) years, 79% were male, and 94% were Caucasian. At baseline, 98% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median number of prior treatments was 3 (range: 2 to 11); all patients received prior PNA therapy, including 29% in combination with rituximab. The most common other prior treatment regimens were rituximab monotherapy (51%), interferon-alpha (25%), and a BRAF inhibitor (18%). At baseline, 33% (26/80) of patients had low hemoglobin (< 10 g/dL), 68% (54/80) of patients had neutropenia (< 1000/mm 3 ), and 84% (67/80) patients had baseline platelet counts < 100,000/mm 3 . About 35% of patients had enlarged spleens (≥ 14 cm, assessed by BICR) at baseline. Patients received LUMOXITI 0.04 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each 28‑day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles or until documentation of complete response (CR), disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of follow-up was 16.7 months (range: 2 to 49). An independent review committee (IRC) performed efficacy evaluations using blood, bone marrow, and imaging criteria adapted from previous HCL studies and consensus guidelines. Efficacy of LUMOXITI in HCL was evaluated by the IRC-assessed rate of durable CR, as confirmed by maintenance of hematologic remission (hemoglobin ≥ 11 g/dL, neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm 3 , and platelets ≥ 100,000/mm 3 without transfusions or growth factor for at least 4 weeks) more than 180 days after IRC-assessed CR. The IRC-assessed durable CR rate was 30% (24/80 patients; 95% CI: 20, 41). Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall response rate (ORR), CR, and duration of response (see Table 6). Table 6: Additional Efficacy Results in Patients with HCL in Study 1053 Independent Review Committee (IRC) Assessed N=80 Overall Response Rate Overall Response Rate ORR defined as best overall response of CR or PR. (%) [95% CI] 75 [64, 84] Complete Response CR defined as clearing of the bone marrow of hairy cells by routine Hematoxylin & Eosin stain, radiologic resolution of pre-existing lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly, and hematologic remission. (%) [95% CI] 41 [30, 53] Partial Response PR defined as ≥ 50% decrease or normalization (< 500/mm 3 ) in peripheral blood lymphocyte count, reduction of pre-existing lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly, and hematologic remission. (%) [95% CI] 34 [24, 45] Duration of Response Median in months [range] NR [0+ to 43+] Duration of CR Median in months [range] NR [0+ to 40+] CI=Confidence Interval; NR=Not Reached; + indicates censored observations The median time to ORR and CR was 5.7 months (range: 1.8 to 12.9) and 5.9 months (range 1.8 to 13.2), respectively. Sixty-four patients (80%) had normalization of hematologic parameters and achieved hematologic remission, with a median time to hematologic remission of 1.1 months (range: 0.2 to 13) and with a median duration of hematologic remission not reached (range: 0.3 to 48.2+). \n",
