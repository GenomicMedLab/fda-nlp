      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD in Adults In a U.S., multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 103 patients were treated for up to eight weeks with placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily. For this and all studies of GERD healing, only patients with GERD symptoms and at least grade 2 esophagitis (modified Hetzel-Dent grading scale) were eligible for entry. Endoscopic healing was defined as grade 0 or 1. Each rabeprazole dose was significantly superior to placebo in producing endoscopic healing after four and eight weeks of treatment. The percentage of patients demonstrating endoscopic healing was as follows: Table 7: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Percentage of Patients Healed *(p<0.001 versus placebo) Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets Week 10 mg once daily N=27 20 mg once daily N=25 40 mg once daily N=26 Placebo N=25 4 63%* 56%* 54%* 0% 8 93%* 84%* 85%* 12% In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the rabeprazole sodium 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg doses compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 regarding complete resolution of GERD heartburn frequency (p≤0.026). All rabeprazole sodium groups reported significantly greater rates of complete resolution of GERD daytime heartburn severity compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 (p≤0.036). Mean reductions from baseline in daily antacid dose were statistically significant for all rabeprazole sodium groups when compared to placebo at both Weeks 4 and 8 (p≤0.007). In a North American multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study of 336 patients, the percentage of patients healed at endoscopy after four and eight weeks of treatment was statistically superior in the patients treated with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets compared to ranitidine: Table 8: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Percentage of Patients Healed *(p<0.001 versus ranitidine) Week 20 mg Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily N=167 Ranitidine 150 mg four times daily N=169 4 59%* 36% 8 87%* 66% A dose of 20 mg once daily of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets was significantly more effective than ranitidine 150 mg four times daily in the percentage of patients with complete resolution of heartburn at Weeks 4 and 8 (p<0.001). Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets was also more effective in complete resolution of daytime heartburn (p≤0.025), and nighttime heartburn (p≤0.012) at both Weeks 4 and 8, with significant differences by the end of the first week of the study. The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 to 8 weeks. 14.2 Long-Term Maintenance of Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD in Adults The long-term maintenance of healing in patients with erosive or ulcerative GERD previously healed with gastric antisecretory therapy was assessed in two U.S., multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of identical design of 52 weeks duration. The two studies randomized 209 and 285 patients, respectively, to receive either 10 mg or 20 mg of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily or placebo. As demonstrated in Tables 10 and 11 below, patients treated with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets were significantly superior to placebo in both studies with respect to the maintenance of healing of GERD and the proportions of patients remaining free of heartburn symptoms at 52 weeks. The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily.

Patients reported 5 or more periods of moderate to very severe heartburn during the placebo treatment phase the week prior to randomization. Patients were confirmed by endoscopy to have no esophageal erosions. The percentage of heartburn free daytime and/or nighttime periods was greater with 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets compared to placebo over the 4 weeks of study in Study RAB-USA-2 (47% vs. 23%) and Study RAB-USA-3 (52% vs. 28%). The mean decreases from baseline in average daytime and nighttime heartburn scores were significantly greater for rabeprazole sodium 20 mg as compared to placebo at week 4. Graphical displays depicting the daily mean daytime and nighttime scores are provided in Figures 2 to 5. In addition, the combined analysis of these two studies showed 20 mg of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets significantly improved other GERD-associated symptoms (regurgitation, belching, and early satiety) by week 4 compared with placebo (all p values <0.005). A dose of 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets also significantly reduced daily antacid consumption versus placebo over 4 weeks (p<0.001). The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks. figure 2 figure 3 figure 4 figure 5 14.4 Healing of Duodenal Ulcers in Adults In a U.S., randomized, double-blind, multicenter study assessing the effectiveness of 20 mg and 40 mg of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily versus placebo for healing endoscopically defined duodenal ulcers, 100 patients were treated for up to four weeks. Rabeprazole sodium was significantly superior to placebo in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing are presented below: Table 11: Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Percentage of Patients Healed * p≤0.001 versus placebo Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets Week 20 mg once daily N=34 40 mg once daily N=33 Placebo N=33 2 44% 42% 21% 4 79% * 91% * 39% At Weeks 2 and 4, significantly more patients in the rabeprazole sodium 20 and 40 mg groups reported complete resolution of ulcer pain frequency (p≤0.018), daytime pain severity (p≤0.023), and nighttime pain severity (p≤0.035) compared with placebo patients. The only exception was the 40 mg group versus placebo at Week 2 for duodenal ulcer pain frequency (p=0.094). Significant differences in resolution of daytime and nighttime pain were noted in both rabeprazole sodium groups relative to placebo by the end of the first week of the study. Significant reductions in daily antacid use were also noted in both rabeprazole sodium groups compared to placebo at Weeks 2 and 4 (p<0.001). An international randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted in 205 patients comparing 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily with 20 mg omeprazole once daily. The study was designed to provide at least 80% power to exclude a difference of at least 10% between rabeprazole sodium and omeprazole, assuming four-week healing response rates of 93% for both groups. In patients with endoscopically defined duodenal ulcers treated for up to four weeks, rabeprazole sodium was comparable to omeprazole in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing at two and four weeks are presented below: Table 12: Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Percentage of Patients Healed Week Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets 20 mg once daily N=102 Omeprazole 20 mg once daily N=103 95% Confidence Interval for the Treatment Difference (Rabeprazole Sodium-Omeprazole) 2 69% 61% (–6%, 22%) 4 98% 93% (–3%, 15%) Rabeprazole sodium and omeprazole were comparable in providing complete resolution of symptoms. The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks. 14.5 Helicobacter pylori Eradication in Patients with Peptic Ulcer Disease or Symptomatic Non-Ulcer Disease in Adults The U.S. multicenter study was a double-blind, parallel-group comparison of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 3, 7, or 10 days vs. omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 10 days. Therapy consisted of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (RAC) or omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (OAC). Patients with H. pylori infection were stratified in a 1:1 ratio for those with peptic ulcer disease (active or a history of ulcer in the past five years) [PUD] and those who were symptomatic but without peptic ulcer disease [NPUD], as determined by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The overall H. pylori eradication rates, defined as negative 13 C-UBT for H. pylori ≥6 weeks from the end of the treatment are shown in the following table. The eradication rates in the 7-day and 10-day RAC regimens were found to be similar to 10-day OAC regimen using either the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) or Per-Protocol (PP) populations. Eradication rates in the RAC 3-day regimen were inferior to the other regimens. Table 13: Helicobacter pylori Eradication at ≥6 Weeks After the End of Treatment a Patients were included in the analysis if they had H. pylori infection documented at baseline, defined as a positive 13 C-UBT plus rapid urease test or culture and were not protocol violators. Patients who dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug were included in the evaluable analysis as failures of therapy. b Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline as defined above and took at least one dose of study medication. All dropouts were included as failures of therapy. * The 95% confidence intervals for the difference in eradication rates for 7-day RAC minus 10-day RAC are (- 9.3, 6.0) in the PP population and (- 9.0, 7.5) in the ITT population. Treatment Group Percent (%) of Patients Cured (Number of Patients) Difference (RAC – OAC) [95% Confidence Interval] 7-day RAC* 10-day OAC Per Protoco a 84.3% (N=166) 81.6% (N=179) 2.8 [- 5.2, 10.7] Intent-to-Treat b 77.3% (N=194) 73.3% (N=206) 4.0 [- 4.4, 12.5] 10-day RAC* 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 86.0% (N=171) 81.6% (N=179) 4.4 [- 3.3, 12.1] Intent-to-Treat b 78.1% (N=196) 73.3% (N=206) 4.8 [- 3.6, 13.2] 3-day RAC 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 29.9% (N=167) 81.6% (N=179) - 51.6 [- 60.6, - 42.6] Intent-to-Treat b 27.3% (N=187) 73.3% (N=206) - 46.0 [- 54.8, - 37.2] The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg twice daily with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 7 days. 14.6 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions, Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome in Adults Twelve patients with idiopathic gastric hypersecretion or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated successfully with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets at doses from 20 to 120 mg for up to 12 months. Rabeprazole sodium produced satisfactory inhibition of gastric acid secretion in all patients and complete resolution of signs and symptoms of acid-peptic disease where present. Rabeprazole sodium also prevented recurrence of gastric hypersecretion and manifestations of acid-peptic disease in all patients. The high doses of rabeprazole sodium used to treat this small cohort of patients with gastric hypersecretion were well tolerated. The recommended starting dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 60 mg once daily. \n",
