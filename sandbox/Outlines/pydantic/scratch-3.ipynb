Patients were dosed with DSUVIA 30 mcg or placebo as needed with a minimum of 60 minutes between doses. Morphine sulfate 1 mg IV was available as rescue medication. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time-weighted summed pain intensity difference over 12 hours (SPID12). Patients using DSUVIA had a statistically significantly higher SPID12 than patients using placebo. Least squares means of pain intensity difference from baseline over 24 hours for the abdominal surgery study are shown in Figure 2 . Median time to onset of meaningful pain relief (measured using the double stopwatch method) was 54 minutes for the DSUVIA group and 84 minutes for the placebo group. Approximately 22% of patients in the DSUVIA group and 65% of patients in the placebo group took rescue medication within the first 12 hours of the treatment phase.

Four trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinson’s disease and no concomitant L-dopa and seven trials were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease with concomitant L-dopa. Three placebo-controlled trials provide evidence of effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the management of patients with Parkinson’s disease who were and were not receiving concomitant L-dopa. Two of these three trials enrolled patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) and one enrolled patients receiving L-dopa. In these trials a variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g., the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scores, patient diaries recording time “on” and “off,” tolerability of L-dopa dose reductions). In both trials of patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa), the motor component (Part III) of the UPDRS was the primary outcome assessment. The UPDRS is a multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor performance (Part III), and complications of therapy (Part IV). Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 items designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinson’s disease (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) scored for different body regions and has a maximum (worst) score of 108. In the trial of patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (with L-dopa), both reduction in percent awake time spent “off” and the ability to reduce the daily use of L-dopa were assessed as a combined endpoint and individually. Trials in Patients with Early Parkinson’s Disease (without L-dopa) Trial 1 was a 12-week multicenter trial in which 63 patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease receiving concomitant anti-Parkinson medication (but not L-dopa) were enrolled and 41 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 22 to placebo. Patients had a mean disease duration of approximately 2 years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented with bradykinesia and at least tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. In addition, they must have been classified as Hoehn & Yahr Stage I-IV. This scale, ranging from I = unilateral involvement with minimal impairment to V = confined to wheelchair or bed, is a standard instrument used for staging patients with Parkinson’s disease. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the proportion of patients experiencing a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 30% in the UPDRS motor score. Patients were titrated for up to 10 weeks, starting at 0.5 mg twice daily, with weekly increments of 0.5 mg twice daily to a maximum of 5 mg twice daily. Once patients reached their maximally tolerated dose (or 5 mg twice daily), they were maintained on that dose through 12 weeks. The mean dose achieved by patients at trial endpoint was 7.4 mg/day. Mean baseline UPDRS motor score was 18.6 for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 19.9 for patients treated with placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 6). Table 6. Percent Responders for UPDRS Motor Score in Trial 1 (Intent-to-Treat Population) % Responders Difference from Placebo Placebo 41% NA ropinirole tablets 71% 30% Trial 2 in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial. In this trial, 241 patients were enrolled and 116 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 125 to placebo. Patients were essentially similar to those in the trial described above; concomitant use of selegiline was allowed, but patients were not permitted to use anticholinergics or amantadine during the trial. Patients had a mean disease duration of 2 years and limited (not more than a 6-week period) or no prior exposure to L-dopa. The starting dosage of ropinirole tablets in this trial was 0.25 mg three times daily. The dosage was titrated at weekly intervals by increments of 0.25 mg three times daily to a dosage of 1 mg three times daily. Further titrations at weekly intervals were at increments of 0.5 mg three times daily up to a dosage of 3 mg three times daily, and then weekly at increments of 1 mg three times daily. Patients were to be titrated to a dosage of at least 1.5 mg three times daily and then to their maximally tolerated dosage, up to a maximum of 8 mg three times daily. The mean dose attained in patients at trial endpoint was 15.7 mg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the mean percent reduction (improvement) from baseline in the UPDRS motor score. At the end of the 6-month trial, patients treated with ropinirole tablets showed improvement in motor score compared with placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 7). Table 7. Mean Percentage Change from Baseline in UPDRS Motor Score at End of Treatment in Trial 2 (Intent-to-Treat Population) Treatment Baseline UPDRS Motor Score Mean Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Placebo 17.7 +4% NA ropinirole tablets 17.9 -22% -26% Trial in Patients with Advanced Parkinson’s Disease (with L-dopa) Trial 3 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial that randomized 149 patients (Hoehn & Yahr II-IV) who were not adequately controlled on L-dopa. Ninety-five patients were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 54 were randomized to placebo. Patients in this trial had a mean disease duration of approximately 9 years, had been exposed to L-dopa for approximately 7 years, and had experienced “on-off” periods with L-dopa therapy. Patients previously receiving stable doses of selegiline, amantadine, and/or anticholinergic agents could continue on these agents during the trial. Patients were started at a dosage of 0.25 mg three times daily of ropinirole tablets and titrated upward by weekly intervals until an optimal therapeutic response was achieved. The maximum dosage of trial medication was 8 mg three times daily. All patients had to be titrated to at least a dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily. Patients could then be maintained on this dosage level or higher for the remainder of the trial. Once a dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily was achieved, patients underwent a mandatory reduction in their L-dopa dosage, to be followed by additional mandatory reductions with continued escalation of the dosage of ropinirole tablets. Reductions in the dosage of L-dopa were also allowed if patients experienced adverse reactions that the investigator considered related to dopaminergic therapy. The mean dose attained at trial endpoint was 16.3 mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who were able both to achieve a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 20% in their L-dopa dosage and a decrease of at least 20% in the proportion of the time awake in the “off” condition (a period of time during the day when patients are particularly immobile), as determined by subject diary. In addition, the mean change in “off” time from baseline and the percent change from baseline in daily L-dopa dosage were examined. At the end of 6 months, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 8). Based on the protocol-mandated reductions in L-dopa dosage with escalating doses of ropinirole tablets, patients treated with ropinirole tablets had a 19.4% mean reduction in L-dopa dosage while patients treated with placebo had a 3% reduction. Mean daily L-dopa dosage at baseline was 759 mg for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 843 mg for patients treated with placebo. The mean number of daily “off” hours at baseline was 6.4 hours for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 7.3 hours for patients treated with placebo. At the end of the 6-month trial, there was a mean reduction of 1.5 hours of “off” time in patients treated with ropinirole tablets and a mean reduction of 0.9 hours of “off” time in patients treated with placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 0.6 hours of “off” time. Table 8. Mean Responder Percentage of Patients Reducing Daily L-Dopa Dosage by at Least 20% and Daily Proportion of “Off” Time by at Least 20% at End of Treatment in Trial 3 (Intent-to-Treat Population) Treatment % Responders Difference from Placebo Placebo 11% NA Ropinirole tablets 28% 17% 14.2 Restless Legs Syndrome The effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Patients were required to have a history of a minimum of 15 RLS episodes/month during the previous month and a total score of ≥15 on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS scale) at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, anemia) were excluded. All trials employed flexible dosing, with patients initiating therapy at 0.25 mg ropinirole tablets once daily. Patients were titrated based on clinical response and tolerability over 7 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg once daily. All doses were taken between 1 and 3 hours before bedtime. A variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment, including the IRLS scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. Three of the controlled trials utilized the change from baseline in the IRLS scale at the Week 12 endpoint as the primary efficacy outcome. Three hundred eighty patients were randomized to receive ropinirole tablets (n = 187) or placebo (n = 193) in a US trial (RLS-1); 284 were randomized to receive either ropinirole tablets (n = 146) or placebo (n = 138) in a multinational trial (excluding US) (RLS-2); and 267 patients were randomized to ropinirole tablets (n = 131) or placebo (n = 136) in a multinational trial (including US) (RLS-3). Across the three trials, the mean duration of RLS was 16 to 22 years (range: 0 to 65 years), mean age was approximately 54 years (range: 18 to 79 years), and approximately 61% were women. The mean dose at Week 12 was approximately 2 mg/day for the three trials. At baseline, mean total IRLS score was 22 for ropinirole tablets and 21.6 for placebo in RLS-1, was 24.4 for ropinirole tablets and 25.2 for placebo in RLS-2, and was 23.6 for ropinirole tablets and 24.8 for placebo in RLS-3. In all three trials, a statistically significant difference between the treatment group receiving ropinirole tablets and the treatment group receiving placebo was observed at Week 12 for both the mean change from baseline in the IRLS scale total score and the percentage of patients rated as responders (much improved or very much improved) on the CGI-I (see Table 9). Table 9. Mean Change in Total IRLS Score and Percent Responders on CGI-I Ropinirole Tablets Placebo Difference from Placebo Mean change in total IRLS score at Week 12 RLS-1 -13.5 -9.8 -3.7 RLS-2 -11.0 -8.0 -3.0 RLS-3 -11.2 -8.7 -2.5 Percent responders on CGI-I at Week 12 RLS-1 73.3% 56.5% 16.8% RLS-2 53.4% 40.9% 12.5% RLS-3 59.5% 39.6% 19.9% Long-term maintenance of efficacy in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in a 36-week trial. Following a 24-week, single-blind treatment phase (flexible dosages of ropinirole tablets of 0.25 to 4 mg once daily), patients who were responders (defined as a decrease of >6 points on the IRLS scale total score relative to baseline) were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or continuation of ropinirole tablets for an additional 12 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase of at least 6 points on the IRLS scale total score to a total score of at least 15, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. For patients who were responders at Week 24, the mean dose of ropinirole tablets were 2 mg (range: 0.25 to 4 mg). Patients continued on ropinirole tablets demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate compared with patients randomized to placebo (32.6% versus 57.8%, P = 0.0156).\\nRESULTS: ']"

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of DSUVIA were evaluated in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which enrolled 161 patients (age 18 to 69 years) with acute postoperative pain (pain intensity of ≥ 4 on a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]) after abdominal surgery (studied up to 48 hours) (Study SAP301, NCT# 02356588). Patients were dosed with DSUVIA 30 mcg or placebo as needed with a minimum of 60 minutes between doses. Morphine sulfate 1 mg IV was available as rescue medication. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time-weighted summed pain intensity difference over 12 hours (SPID12). Patients using DSUVIA had a statistically significantly higher SPID12 than patients using placebo. Least squares means of pain intensity difference from baseline over 24 hours for the abdominal surgery study are shown in Figure 2 . Median time to onset of meaningful pain relief (measured using the double stopwatch method) was 54 minutes for the DSUVIA group and 84 minutes for the placebo group. Approximately 22% of patients in the DSUVIA group and 65% of patients in the placebo group took rescue medication within the first 12 hours of the treatment phase.

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Parkinson's Disease The effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of 11 randomized, controlled trials. Four trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinson’s disease and no concomitant L-dopa and seven trials were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease with concomitant L-dopa. Three placebo-controlled trials provide evidence of effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the management of patients with Parkinson’s disease who were and were not receiving concomitant L-dopa. Two of these three trials enrolled patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) and one enrolled patients receiving L-dopa. In these trials a variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g., the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scores, patient diaries recording time “on” and “off,” tolerability of L-dopa dose reductions). In both trials of patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa), the motor component (Part III) of the UPDRS was the primary outcome assessment. The UPDRS is a multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor performance (Part III), and complications of therapy (Part IV). Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 items designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinson’s disease (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) scored for different body regions and has a maximum (worst) score of 108. In the trial of patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (with L-dopa), both reduction in percent awake time spent “off” and the ability to reduce the daily use of L-dopa were assessed as a combined endpoint and individually. Trials in Patients with Early Parkinson’s Disease (without L-dopa) Trial 1 was a 12-week multicenter trial in which 63 patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease receiving concomitant anti-Parkinson medication (but not L-dopa) were enrolled and 41 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 22 to placebo. Patients had a mean disease duration of approximately 2 years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented with bradykinesia and at least tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. In addition, they must have been classified as Hoehn & Yahr Stage I-IV. This scale, ranging from I = unilateral involvement with minimal impairment to V = confined to wheelchair or bed, is a standard instrument used for staging patients with Parkinson’s disease. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the proportion of patients experiencing a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 30% in the UPDRS motor score. Patients were titrated for up to 10 weeks, starting at 0.5 mg twice daily, with weekly increments of 0.5 mg twice daily to a maximum of 5 mg twice daily. Once patients reached their maximally tolerated dose (or 5 mg twice daily), they were maintained on that dose through 12 weeks. The mean dose achieved by patients at trial endpoint was 7.4 mg/day. Mean baseline UPDRS motor score was 18.6 for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 19.9 for patients treated with placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 6). Table 6. Percent Responders for UPDRS Motor Score in Trial 1 (Intent-to-Treat Population) % Responders Difference from Placebo Placebo 41% NA ropinirole tablets 71% 30% Trial 2 in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial. In this trial, 241 patients were enrolled and 116 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 125 to placebo. Patients were essentially similar to those in the trial described above; concomitant use of selegiline was allowed, but patients were not permitted to use anticholinergics or amantadine during the trial. Patients had a mean disease duration of 2 years and limited (not more than a 6-week period) or no prior exposure to L-dopa. The starting dosage of ropinirole tablets in this trial was 0.25 mg three times daily. The dosage was titrated at weekly intervals by increments of 0.25 mg three times daily to a dosage of 1 mg three times daily. Further titrations at weekly intervals were at increments of 0.5 mg three times daily up to a dosage of 3 mg three times daily, and then weekly at increments of 1 mg three times daily. Patients were to be titrated to a dosage of at least 1.5 mg three times daily and then to their maximally tolerated dosage, up to a maximum of 8 mg three times daily. The mean dose attained in patients at trial endpoint was 15.7 mg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the mean percent reduction (improvement) from baseline in the UPDRS motor score. At the end of the 6-month trial, patients treated with ropinirole tablets showed improvement in motor score compared with placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 7). Table 7. Mean Percentage Change from Baseline in UPDRS Motor Score at End of Treatment in Trial 2 (Intent-to-Treat Population) Treatment Baseline UPDRS Motor Score Mean Change from Baseline Difference from Placebo Placebo 17.7 +4% NA ropinirole tablets 17.9 -22% -26% Trial in Patients with Advanced Parkinson’s Disease (with L-dopa) Trial 3 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial that randomized 149 patients (Hoehn & Yahr II-IV) who were not adequately controlled on L-dopa. Ninety-five patients were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 54 were randomized to placebo. Patients in this trial had a mean disease duration of approximately 9 years, had been exposed to L-dopa for approximately 7 years, and had experienced “on-off” periods with L-dopa therapy. Patients previously receiving stable doses of selegiline, amantadine, and/or anticholinergic agents could continue on these agents during the trial. Patients were started at a dosage of 0.25 mg three times daily of ropinirole tablets and titrated upward by weekly intervals until an optimal therapeutic response was achieved. The maximum dosage of trial medication was 8 mg three times daily. All patients had to be titrated to at least a dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily. Patients could then be maintained on this dosage level or higher for the remainder of the trial. Once a dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily was achieved, patients underwent a mandatory reduction in their L-dopa dosage, to be followed by additional mandatory reductions with continued escalation of the dosage of ropinirole tablets. Reductions in the dosage of L-dopa were also allowed if patients experienced adverse reactions that the investigator considered related to dopaminergic therapy. The mean dose attained at trial endpoint was 16.3 mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who were able both to achieve a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 20% in their L-dopa dosage and a decrease of at least 20% in the proportion of the time awake in the “off” condition (a period of time during the day when patients are particularly immobile), as determined by subject diary. In addition, the mean change in “off” time from baseline and the percent change from baseline in daily L-dopa dosage were examined. At the end of 6 months, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 8). Based on the protocol-mandated reductions in L-dopa dosage with escalating doses of ropinirole tablets, patients treated with ropinirole tablets had a 19.4% mean reduction in L-dopa dosage while patients treated with placebo had a 3% reduction. Mean daily L-dopa dosage at baseline was 759 mg for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 843 mg for patients treated with placebo. The mean number of daily “off” hours at baseline was 6.4 hours for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 7.3 hours for patients treated with placebo. At the end of the 6-month trial, there was a mean reduction of 1.5 hours of “off” time in patients treated with ropinirole tablets and a mean reduction of 0.9 hours of “off” time in patients treated with placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 0.6 hours of “off” time. Table 8. Mean Responder Percentage of Patients Reducing Daily L-Dopa Dosage by at Least 20% and Daily Proportion of “Off” Time by at Least 20% at End of Treatment in Trial 3 (Intent-to-Treat Population) Treatment % Responders Difference from Placebo Placebo 11% NA Ropinirole tablets 28% 17% 14.2 Restless Legs Syndrome The effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Patients were required to have a history of a minimum of 15 RLS episodes/month during the previous month and a total score of ≥15 on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS scale) at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, anemia) were excluded. All trials employed flexible dosing, with patients initiating therapy at 0.25 mg ropinirole tablets once daily. Patients were titrated based on clinical response and tolerability over 7 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg once daily. All doses were taken between 1 and 3 hours before bedtime. A variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment, including the IRLS scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. Three of the controlled trials utilized the change from baseline in the IRLS scale at the Week 12 endpoint as the primary efficacy outcome. Three hundred eighty patients were randomized to receive ropinirole tablets (n = 187) or placebo (n = 193) in a US trial (RLS-1); 284 were randomized to receive either ropinirole tablets (n = 146) or placebo (n = 138) in a multinational trial (excluding US) (RLS-2); and 267 patients were randomized to ropinirole tablets (n = 131) or placebo (n = 136) in a multinational trial (including US) (RLS-3). Across the three trials, the mean duration of RLS was 16 to 22 years (range: 0 to 65 years), mean age was approximately 54 years (range: 18 to 79 years), and approximately 61% were women. The mean dose at Week 12 was approximately 2 mg/day for the three trials. At baseline, mean total IRLS score was 22 for ropinirole tablets and 21.6 for placebo in RLS-1, was 24.4 for ropinirole tablets and 25.2 for placebo in RLS-2, and was 23.6 for ropinirole tablets and 24.8 for placebo in RLS-3. In all three trials, a statistically significant difference between the treatment group receiving ropinirole tablets and the treatment group receiving placebo was observed at Week 12 for both the mean change from baseline in the IRLS scale total score and the percentage of patients rated as responders (much improved or very much improved) on the CGI-I (see Table 9). Table 9. Mean Change in Total IRLS Score and Percent Responders on CGI-I Ropinirole Tablets Placebo Difference from Placebo Mean change in total IRLS score at Week 12 RLS-1 -13.5 -9.8 -3.7 RLS-2 -11.0 -8.0 -3.0 RLS-3 -11.2 -8.7 -2.5 Percent responders on CGI-I at Week 12 RLS-1 73.3% 56.5% 16.8% RLS-2 53.4% 40.9% 12.5% RLS-3 59.5% 39.6% 19.9% Long-term maintenance of efficacy in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in a 36-week trial. Following a 24-week, single-blind treatment phase (flexible dosages of ropinirole tablets of 0.25 to 4 mg once daily), patients who were responders (defined as a decrease of >6 points on the IRLS scale total score relative to baseline) were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or continuation of ropinirole tablets for an additional 12 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase of at least 6 points on the IRLS scale total score to a total score of at least 15, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. For patients who were responders at Week 24, the mean dose of ropinirole tablets were 2 mg (range: 0.25 to 4 mg). Patients continued on ropinirole tablets demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate compared with patients randomized to placebo (32.6% versus 57.8%, P = 0.0156).\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Effects in Hypertension Adult Patients The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine besylate has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine besylate and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24 hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients. Pediatric Patients Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine besylate 2.5 mg or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults. 14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine besylate in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine besylate, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine besylate, 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine besylate, 5 mg. Amlodipine besylate, 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine besylate in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm). 14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine besylate therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p < 0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine besylate and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement. 14.4 Effects in Documented Coronary Artery Disease In PREVENT, 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease were randomized to amlodipine besylate (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo and followed for 3 years. Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD. CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main coronary disease and without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40%. Patients (76% males, 89% Caucasian, 93% enrolled at U.S. sites, 89% with a history of angina, 52% without PCI, 4% with PCI and no stent, and 44% with a stent) were randomized to double-blind treatment with either amlodipine besylate (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89%), statins (83%), beta-blockers (74%), nitroglycerin (50%), anti-coagulants (40%), and diuretics (32%), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events: hospitalization for angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease. A total of 110 (16.6%) and 151 (23.1%) first events occurred in the amlodipine besylate and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.540 to 0.884, p = 0.003). The primary endpoint is summarized in Figure 1 below. The outcome of this study was largely derived from the prevention of hospitalizations for angina and the prevention of revascularization procedures (see Table 1). Effects in various subgroups are shown in Figure 2. In an angiographic substudy (n = 274) conducted within CAMELOT, there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo on the change of atheroma volume in the coronary artery as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Composite Clinical Outcomes for Amlodipine Besylate Versus Placebo Figure 2 - Effects on Primary Endpoint of Amlodipine Besylate Versus Placebo Across Sub-Groups Table 1 below summarizes the significant composite endpoint and clinical outcomes from the composites of the primary endpoint. The other components of the primary endpoint including cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease did not demonstrate a significant difference between amlodipine besylate and placebo.

In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular ejection fraction. In a long-term (follow-up at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo-controlled mortality/morbidity study of amlodipine besylate, 5 to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n = 931) or IV (n = 222) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, amlodipine besylate had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of heart failure. Total combined all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222/571 (39%) for patients on amlodipine besylate and 246/583 (42%) for patients on placebo; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25% of the endpoints in the study. Another study (PRAISE-2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%), to placebo (n = 827) or amlodipine besylate (n = 827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine besylate and placebo in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on amlodipine besylate). With amlodipine besylate there were more reports of pulmonary edema.\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD in Adults In a U.S., multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 103 patients were treated for up to eight weeks with placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily. For this and all studies of GERD healing, only patients with GERD symptoms and at least grade 2 esophagitis (modified Hetzel-Dent grading scale) were eligible for entry. Endoscopic healing was defined as grade 0 or 1. Each rabeprazole dose was significantly superior to placebo in producing endoscopic healing after four and eight weeks of treatment. The percentage of patients demonstrating endoscopic healing was as follows: Table 7: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Percentage of Patients Healed *(p<0.001 versus placebo) Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets Week 10 mg once daily N=27 20 mg once daily N=25 40 mg once daily N=26 Placebo N=25 4 63%* 56%* 54%* 0% 8 93%* 84%* 85%* 12% In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the rabeprazole sodium 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg doses compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 regarding complete resolution of GERD heartburn frequency (p≤0.026). All rabeprazole sodium groups reported significantly greater rates of complete resolution of GERD daytime heartburn severity compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 (p≤0.036). Mean reductions from baseline in daily antacid dose were statistically significant for all rabeprazole sodium groups when compared to placebo at both Weeks 4 and 8 (p≤0.007). In a North American multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study of 336 patients, the percentage of patients healed at endoscopy after four and eight weeks of treatment was statistically superior in the patients treated with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets compared to ranitidine: Table 8: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Percentage of Patients Healed *(p<0.001 versus ranitidine) Week 20 mg Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily N=167 Ranitidine 150 mg four times daily N=169 4 59%* 36% 8 87%* 66% A dose of 20 mg once daily of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets was significantly more effective than ranitidine 150 mg four times daily in the percentage of patients with complete resolution of heartburn at Weeks 4 and 8 (p<0.001). Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets was also more effective in complete resolution of daytime heartburn (p≤0.025), and nighttime heartburn (p≤0.012) at both Weeks 4 and 8, with significant differences by the end of the first week of the study. The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 to 8 weeks. 14.2 Long-Term Maintenance of Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD in Adults The long-term maintenance of healing in patients with erosive or ulcerative GERD previously healed with gastric antisecretory therapy was assessed in two U.S., multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of identical design of 52 weeks duration. The two studies randomized 209 and 285 patients, respectively, to receive either 10 mg or 20 mg of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily or placebo. As demonstrated in Tables 10 and 11 below, patients treated with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets were significantly superior to placebo in both studies with respect to the maintenance of healing of GERD and the proportions of patients remaining free of heartburn symptoms at 52 weeks. The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily.

Patients reported 5 or more periods of moderate to very severe heartburn during the placebo treatment phase the week prior to randomization. Patients were confirmed by endoscopy to have no esophageal erosions. The percentage of heartburn free daytime and/or nighttime periods was greater with 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets compared to placebo over the 4 weeks of study in Study RAB-USA-2 (47% vs. 23%) and Study RAB-USA-3 (52% vs. 28%). The mean decreases from baseline in average daytime and nighttime heartburn scores were significantly greater for rabeprazole sodium 20 mg as compared to placebo at week 4. Graphical displays depicting the daily mean daytime and nighttime scores are provided in Figures 2 to 5. In addition, the combined analysis of these two studies showed 20 mg of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets significantly improved other GERD-associated symptoms (regurgitation, belching, and early satiety) by week 4 compared with placebo (all p values <0.005). A dose of 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets also significantly reduced daily antacid consumption versus placebo over 4 weeks (p<0.001). The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks. figure 2 figure 3 figure 4 figure 5 14.4 Healing of Duodenal Ulcers in Adults In a U.S., randomized, double-blind, multicenter study assessing the effectiveness of 20 mg and 40 mg of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily versus placebo for healing endoscopically defined duodenal ulcers, 100 patients were treated for up to four weeks. Rabeprazole sodium was significantly superior to placebo in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing are presented below: Table 11: Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Percentage of Patients Healed * p≤0.001 versus placebo Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets Week 20 mg once daily N=34 40 mg once daily N=33 Placebo N=33 2 44% 42% 21% 4 79% * 91% * 39% At Weeks 2 and 4, significantly more patients in the rabeprazole sodium 20 and 40 mg groups reported complete resolution of ulcer pain frequency (p≤0.018), daytime pain severity (p≤0.023), and nighttime pain severity (p≤0.035) compared with placebo patients. The only exception was the 40 mg group versus placebo at Week 2 for duodenal ulcer pain frequency (p=0.094). Significant differences in resolution of daytime and nighttime pain were noted in both rabeprazole sodium groups relative to placebo by the end of the first week of the study. Significant reductions in daily antacid use were also noted in both rabeprazole sodium groups compared to placebo at Weeks 2 and 4 (p<0.001). An international randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted in 205 patients comparing 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily with 20 mg omeprazole once daily. The study was designed to provide at least 80% power to exclude a difference of at least 10% between rabeprazole sodium and omeprazole, assuming four-week healing response rates of 93% for both groups. In patients with endoscopically defined duodenal ulcers treated for up to four weeks, rabeprazole sodium was comparable to omeprazole in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing at two and four weeks are presented below: Table 12: Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Percentage of Patients Healed Week Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets 20 mg once daily N=102 Omeprazole 20 mg once daily N=103 95% Confidence Interval for the Treatment Difference (Rabeprazole Sodium-Omeprazole) 2 69% 61% (–6%, 22%) 4 98% 93% (–3%, 15%) Rabeprazole sodium and omeprazole were comparable in providing complete resolution of symptoms. The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks. 14.5 Helicobacter pylori Eradication in Patients with Peptic Ulcer Disease or Symptomatic Non-Ulcer Disease in Adults The U.S. multicenter study was a double-blind, parallel-group comparison of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 3, 7, or 10 days vs. omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 10 days. Therapy consisted of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (RAC) or omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (OAC). Patients with H. pylori infection were stratified in a 1:1 ratio for those with peptic ulcer disease (active or a history of ulcer in the past five years) [PUD] and those who were symptomatic but without peptic ulcer disease [NPUD], as determined by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The overall H. pylori eradication rates, defined as negative 13 C-UBT for H. pylori ≥6 weeks from the end of the treatment are shown in the following table. The eradication rates in the 7-day and 10-day RAC regimens were found to be similar to 10-day OAC regimen using either the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) or Per-Protocol (PP) populations. Eradication rates in the RAC 3-day regimen were inferior to the other regimens. Table 13: Helicobacter pylori Eradication at ≥6 Weeks After the End of Treatment a Patients were included in the analysis if they had H. pylori infection documented at baseline, defined as a positive 13 C-UBT plus rapid urease test or culture and were not protocol violators. Patients who dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug were included in the evaluable analysis as failures of therapy. b Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline as defined above and took at least one dose of study medication. All dropouts were included as failures of therapy. * The 95% confidence intervals for the difference in eradication rates for 7-day RAC minus 10-day RAC are (- 9.3, 6.0) in the PP population and (- 9.0, 7.5) in the ITT population. Treatment Group Percent (%) of Patients Cured (Number of Patients) Difference (RAC – OAC) [95% Confidence Interval] 7-day RAC* 10-day OAC Per Protoco a 84.3% (N=166) 81.6% (N=179) 2.8 [- 5.2, 10.7] Intent-to-Treat b 77.3% (N=194) 73.3% (N=206) 4.0 [- 4.4, 12.5] 10-day RAC* 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 86.0% (N=171) 81.6% (N=179) 4.4 [- 3.3, 12.1] Intent-to-Treat b 78.1% (N=196) 73.3% (N=206) 4.8 [- 3.6, 13.2] 3-day RAC 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 29.9% (N=167) 81.6% (N=179) - 51.6 [- 60.6, - 42.6] Intent-to-Treat b 27.3% (N=187) 73.3% (N=206) - 46.0 [- 54.8, - 37.2] The recommended dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 20 mg twice daily with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 7 days. 14.6 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions, Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome in Adults Twelve patients with idiopathic gastric hypersecretion or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated successfully with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets at doses from 20 to 120 mg for up to 12 months. Rabeprazole sodium produced satisfactory inhibition of gastric acid secretion in all patients and complete resolution of signs and symptoms of acid-peptic disease where present. Rabeprazole sodium also prevented recurrence of gastric hypersecretion and manifestations of acid-peptic disease in all patients. The high doses of rabeprazole sodium used to treat this small cohort of patients with gastric hypersecretion were well tolerated. The recommended starting dosage of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is 60 mg once daily.\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with “anorectic” drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an “anorectic” drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks’ duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: CLINICAL TRIALS The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in 5 placebo-controlled, short-term trials. Four of these were 6-week trials in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depression: two involving dose titration with venlafaxine hydrochloride in a range of 75 to 225 mg/day (t.i.d. schedule), the third involving fixed venlafaxine hydrochloride doses of 75, 225, and 375 mg/day (t.i.d. schedule), and the fourth involving doses of 25, 75, and 200 mg/day (b.i.d. schedule). The fifth was a 4-week study of adult inpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depression with melancholia whose venlafaxine hydrochloride doses were titrated in a range of 150 to 375 mg/day (t.i.d. schedule). In these 5 studies, venlafaxine hydrochloride was shown to be significantly superior to placebo on at least 2 of the following 3 measures: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (total score), Hamilton depressed mood item, and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness rating. Doses from 75 to 225 mg/day were superior to placebo in outpatient studies and a mean dose of about 350 mg/day was effective in inpatients. Data from the 2 fixed-dose outpatient studies were suggestive of a dose-response relationship in the range of 75 to 225 mg/day. There was no suggestion of increased response with doses greater than 225 mg/day. While there were no efficacy studies focusing specifically on an elderly population, elderly patients were included among the patients studied. Overall, approximately 2/3 of all patients in these trials were women. Exploratory analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex. In one longer-term study, adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an 8-week open trial on venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (75, 150, or 225 mg, qAM) were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule dose or to placebo, for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≤3 and a HAM-D-21 total score of ≤10 at the day 56 evaluation. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as follows: (1) a reappearance of major depressive disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria and a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥4 (moderately ill), (2) 2 consecutive CGI Severity of Illness item scores of ≥4, or (3) a final CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥4 for any patient who withdrew from the study for any reason. Patients receiving continued venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 26 weeks compared with those receiving placebo. In a second longer-term trial, adult outpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depression, recurrent type, who had responded (HAM-D-21 total score ≤12 at the day 56 evaluation) and continued to be improved [defined as the following criteria being met for days 56 through 180: (1) no HAM-D-21 total score ≥20; (2) no more than 2 HAM-D-21 total scores >10; and (3) no single CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥4 (moderately ill)] during an initial 26 weeks of treatment on venlafaxine hydrochloride (100 to 200 mg/day, on a b.i.d. schedule) were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine hydrochloride dose or to placebo. The follow-up period to observe patients for relapse, defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥4, was for up to 52 weeks. Patients receiving continued venlafaxine hydrochloride treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 52 weeks compared with those receiving placebo.\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of the Clinical Trials The efficacy of duloxetine has been established in the following populations in adequate and well-controlled trials: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): 4 short-term (Studies MDD-1, MDD-2, MDD-3, and MDD-4) and 1 maintenance trial (Study MDD-5) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): 3 short-term trials in adults (Studies GAD-1, GAD-2, and GAD-3), 1 maintenance trial in adults (Study GAD-4), 1 short-term trial in geriatric patients (Study GAD-5), and 1 short-term trial in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age (Study GAD-6) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP): Two 12-week trials in adults (Studies DPNP-1 and DPNP-2) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Fibromyalgia (FM): Two trials in adults (one of 3 months duration and one of 6 months duration) (Studies FM-1 and FM-2) and one 13-week trial in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age (Study FM-4) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: Two 12- to 13-week trials in adult patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) (Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-3) and one 13-week trial in adult patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) (Study OA-1) [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. Additionally, a summary of the following trials that did not demonstrate efficacy are presented below: Study FM-3 (a 16-week trial in adult patients with fibromyalgia), Study CLBP-2 (a 13-week trial in adult patients with CLBP), and Study OA-2 (a 13-week trial in adult patients with chronic pain due to OA). 14.2 Major Depressive Disorder in Adults The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules as a treatment for MDD in adults was established in 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, fixed-dose trials in adult outpatients (18 to 83 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD: In Studies MDD-1 and MDD-2, patients were randomized to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily (N=123 and N=128, respectively) or placebo (N=122 and N=139, respectively) for 9 weeks In Study MDD-3, patients were randomized to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 or 40 mg twice daily (N=86 and N=91, respectively) or placebo (N=89) for 8 weeks In Study MDD-4, patients were randomized to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 40 or 60 mg twice daily (N=95 and N=93, respectively) or placebo (N=93) for 8 weeks. In all four trials, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) total score (see Table 8 ). There is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefits. In all of these clinical trials, analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

Two hundred and seventy-eight patients who responded to open label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 10 and 12: a HAMD-17 total score ≤9, Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) ≤2, and not meeting the DSM-IV criteria for MDD] were randomly assigned to continuation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same dosage (N=136) or to placebo (N=142) for 6 months. In Study MDD-5, patients on duloxetine experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of depression than did patients on placebo (see Figure 1 ). Relapse was defined as an increase in the CGI-S score of ≥2 points compared with that obtained at week 12, as well as meeting the DSM-IV criteria for MDD at 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart, where the 2-week temporal criterion had to be satisfied at only the second visit. Figure 1: Cumulative Proportion Kaplan-Meier estimator method of Adult Patients with MDD Relapse (Study MDD-5) 14.3 Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD Trials in Adults (Including Geriatric Patients) The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established in 1 fixed-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and 2 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients between 18 and 83 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Studies GAD-1, GAD-2, and GAD-3, respectively). In Studies GAD-1 and GAD-2, the starting dose was 60 mg once daily (down titration to 30 mg once daily was allowed for tolerability reasons; the dosage could be increased to 60 mg once daily). Fifteen percent of patients were down titrated. Study GAD-3 had a starting dose of 30 mg once daily for 1 week before increasing it to 60 mg once daily. Studies GAD-2 and GAD-3 involved dose titration with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules doses ranging from 60 mg once daily to 120 mg once daily (N=168 and N=162) compared to placebo (N=159 and N=161) over a 10-week treatment period. The mean dosage for completers at endpoint in these trials was 104.8 mg/day. Study GAD-1 evaluated Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of 60 mg once daily (N=168) and 120 mg once daily (N=170) compared to placebo (N=175) over a 9-week treatment period. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit. In all 3 trials, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score (see Table 9 ) and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score. The SDS is a composite measurement of the extent emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in 3 life domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities. In Study GAD-4, 887 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD received Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg to 120 mg once daily during an initial 26-week open-label treatment phase. Four hundred and twenty-nine patients who responded to open- label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 24 and 26: a decrease from baseline HAM-A total score by at least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and a Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) score of 1 or 2] were randomly assigned to continuation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same dosage (N=216) or to placebo (N=213) and were observed for relapse. Of the patients randomized, 73% had been in a responder status for at least 10 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score at least 2 points to a score ≥4 and a MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) diagnosis of GAD (excluding duration), or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of GAD than did patients taking placebo (see Figure 2 ). Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. GAD Trial in Geriatric Patients The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of patients ≥65 years of age with GAD was established in one 10-week flexible-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults ≥65 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Study GAD-5). In Study GAD-5, the starting dose was 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks before further dose increases in 30 mg increments at treatment weeks 2, 4, and 7 up to 120 mg once daily were allowed based on investigator judgment of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dosage for patients completing the 10-week acute treatment phase was 51 mg. Patients treated with duloxetine (N=151) demonstrated significantly greater improvement compared with placebo (N=140) on mean change from baseline to endpoint as measured by the HAM-A total score (see Table 9 ). GAD Trial in Pediatric Patients 7 to 17 Years Old The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with GAD was established in 1 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric outpatients with GAD (based on DSM-IV criteria) (Study GAD-6). In Study GAD-6, the starting dosage was 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Further dosage increases in 30 mg increments up to 120 mg once daily were allowed based on investigator judgment of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dosage for patients completing the 10-week treatment phase was 57.6 mg/day. In this study, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (N=135) demonstrated superiority over placebo (N=137) from baseline to endpoint as measured by greater improvement in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) for GAD severity score (see Table 9 ).

These trials enrolled a total of 791 patients of whom 592 (75%) completed the trials. Patients enrolled had Type I or II diabetes mellitus with a diagnosis of painful distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy for at least 6 months. The patients had a baseline pain score of ≥4 on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Patients were permitted up to 4 grams of acetaminophen per day as needed for pain, in addition to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Patients recorded their pain daily in a diary. Both trials compared Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily or 60 mg twice daily with placebo. Study DPNP-1 additionally compared Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 mg with placebo. A total of 457 patients (342 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 115 placebo) were enrolled in Study DPNP-1 and a total of 334 patients (226 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 108 placebo) were enrolled in Study DPNP-2. Treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg one or two times a day statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain scores from baseline and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain scores from baseline. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 3 and 4 show the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Studies DPNP-1 and DPNP-2, respectively. The figures are cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the trial.

Study FM-1 was three months in duration and enrolled female patients only. Study FM-2 was six months in duration and enrolled male and female patients. Approximately 25% of participants had a comorbid diagnosis of MDD. Studies FM-1 and FM-2 enrolled a total of 874 patients of whom 541 (62%) completed the trials. A total of 354 patients (234 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 120 placebo) were enrolled in Study FM-1 and a total of 520 patients (376 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 144 placebo) were enrolled in Study FM-2 (5% male, 95% female). The patients had a baseline pain score of 6.5 on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse possible pain). Studies FM-1 and FM-2 compared Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily or 120 mg daily (given in divided doses in Study FM-1 and as a single daily dose in Study FM-2) with placebo. Study FM-2 additionally compared Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 mg with placebo during the initial three months of a six-month trial. Treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg or 120 mg daily statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain scores from baseline and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain score from baseline. Pain reduction was observed in patients both with and without comorbid MDD. However, the degree of pain reduction may be greater in patients with comorbid MDD. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 5 and 6 show the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Studies FM-1 and FM-2, respectively. The figures are cumulative so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the trial. Improvement was also demonstrated on measures of function (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaires) and patient global impression of change (PGI). Neither trial demonstrated a benefit of 120 mg compared to 60 mg, and a higher dosage was associated with more adverse reactions and premature discontinuations of treatment. Figure 5: Percentage of Adult Fibromyalgia Patients Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief at Study Endpoint as Measured by 24-Hour Average Pain Severity (Study FM-1) Figure 6: Percentage of Adult Fibromyalgia Patients Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief at Study Endpoint as Measured by 24-Hour Average Pain Severity (Study FM-2) Additionally, the benefit of up-titration in non-responders to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at 60 mg/day was evaluated in a separate trial (Study FM-3). Adult patients were initially treated with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily for eight weeks in open-label fashion. Subsequently, completers of this phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at either 60 mg once daily or 120 mg once daily. Responders were defined as patients who had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from baseline at the end of the 8-week treatment. Patients who were non-responders at 8 weeks were no more likely to meet response criteria at the end of 60 weeks of treatment if blindly titrated to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 120 mg as compared to those who were blindly continued on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg. Pediatric Trial in Fibromyalgia Duloxetine delayed-release capsules were studied in 184 pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years with juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome in a 13-week, placebo-controlled trial (Study FM-4). In Study FM-4, 149 (81%) patients completed the trial. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (N=91) were initiated at a dosage of 30 mg once daily for one week and titrated to 60 mg once daily for 12 weeks, as tolerated. The mean dosage for patients completing the 12-week treatment phase was 49 mg/day. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules showed improvement over placebo on the primary endpoint [change from baseline to end-of-treatment on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) – Modified Short Form: Adolescent Version 24-hour average pain severity rating] with a p-value of 0.052 from the pre- specified primary analysis, and p-values ranging from 0.011-0.020 from sensitivity analyses which assigned baseline values to missing assessments of some patients who did not complete the trial for various reasons. The patients had a baseline BPI of 5.7. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 7 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Study FM-4. Figure 7: Percentage of Pediatric Patients Aged 13 to 17 Years Old with Juvenile Fibromyalgia Syndrome Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief at Week 12 (Study FM-4) a 14.6 Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in Adults Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults. This has been established in trials in adult patients with chronic low back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis. Trials in Chronic Low Back Pain in Adults The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in chronic low back pain (CLBP) in adults was assessed in two double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized clinical trials of 13-weeks duration (Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-2), and one of 12-weeks duration (CLBP-3). Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-3 demonstrated efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of CLBP. Patients in all trials had no signs of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis. Study CLBP-1: Two hundred thirty-six adult patients (N=115 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=121 on placebo) enrolled and 182 (77%) completed 13-week treatment phase. After 7 weeks of treatment, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients with less than 30% reduction in average daily pain and who were able to tolerate 60 mg once daily had their Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosage, in a double- blinded fashion, increased to 120 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60-120 mg daily had a significantly greater pain reduction compared to patients taking placebo. Randomization was stratified by the patients' baseline NSAIDs use status. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were differences in treatment outcomes as a function of NSAIDs use. Study CLBP-2: Four hundred and four patients were randomized to receive fixed dosages of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules daily or a matching placebo (N=59 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 mg, N=116 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg, N=112 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 120 mg, N=117 on placebo) and 267 (66%) completed the entire 13-week trial. After 13 weeks of treatment, none of the three Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages showed a statistically significant difference in pain reduction compared to placebo. Study CLBP-3: Four hundred and one patients were randomized to receive fixed doses of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg daily or placebo (N=198 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=203 on placebo), and 303 (76%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 12 weeks of treatment, patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg daily had significantly greater pain reduction compared to patients taking placebo. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 8 and 9 show the fraction of patients in Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-3 achieving that degree of improvement, respectively. The figures are cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned the value of 0% improvement. Figure 8: Percentage of Adult Patients with CLBP Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief as Measured by 24-Hour Average Pain Severity (Study CLBP-1) Figure 9: Percentage of Adult Patients with CLBP Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief as Measured by 24-Hour Average Pain Severity (Study CLBP-3) Trials in Chronic Pain Due to Osteoarthritis in Adults The efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) in adults was assessed in 2 double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized clinical trials of 13-weeks duration (Study OA-1 and Study OA-2). All patients in both trials fulfilled the ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for classification of idiopathic OA of the knee. Randomization was stratified by the patients' baseline NSAIDs-use status. Patients assigned to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules started treatment in both trials at a dose of 30 mg once daily for one week. After the first week, the dose of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules was increased to 60 mg once daily. After 7 weeks of treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily, in Study OA-1 patients with sub-optimal response to treatment (<30% pain reduction) and tolerated Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily had their dose increased to 120 mg. However, in Study OA-2, all patients, regardless of their response to treatment after 7 weeks, were re-randomized to either continue receiving Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily or have their dosage increased to 120 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial. Patients in the placebo treatment groups in both trials received a matching placebo for the entire duration of trials. For both trials, efficacy analyses were conducted using 13-week data from the combined Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg and 120 mg once daily treatment groups compared to the placebo group. Study OA-1: Two hundred fifty-six patients (N=128 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=128 on placebo) enrolled and 204 (80%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules had significantly greater pain reduction than patients taking placebo. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were differences in treatment outcomes as a function of NSAIDs use. Study OA-2: Two hundred thirty-one patients (N=111 on Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=120 on placebo) enrolled and 173 (75%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules did not show a significantly greater pain reduction than patients taking placebo. In Study OA-1, for various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 10 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned the value of 0% improvement.

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Non-Squamous NSCLC Initial Treatment in Combination with Pembrolizumab and Platinum The efficacy of pemetrexed for injection in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-189 (NCT02578680), a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status, who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease and in whom there were no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by smoking status (never versus former/current), choice of platinum (cisplatin versus carboplatin), and tumor PD-L1 status (TPS <1% [negative] versus TPS ≥1%). Patients were randomized (2:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Pemetrexed for Injection 500 mg/m 2 , pembrolizumab 200 mg, and investigator's choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles followed by pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Pemetrexed for Injection was administered after pembrolizumab and prior to platinum chemotherapy on Day 1. Placebo, pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 , and investigator's choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment with pemetrexed for injection continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Patients randomized to placebo, pemetrexed for injection, and platinum chemotherapy were offered pembrolizumab as a single agent at the time of disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed at Week 6, Week 12, and then every 9 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and duration of response, as assessed by the BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. A total of 616 patients were randomized: 410 patients to the pemetrexed for injection, pembrolizumab, and platinum chemotherapy arm and 206 to the placebo, pemetrexed for injection, and platinum chemotherapy arm. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84); 49% age 65 or older; 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; 56% ECOG performance status of 1; and 18% with history of brain metastases. Thirty-one percent had tumor PD-L1 expression TPS <1%. Seventy-two percent received carboplatin and 12% were never smokers. A total of 85 patients in the placebo, pemetrexed for injection, and chemotherapy arm received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS for patients randomized to pemetrexed for injection in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo, pemetrexed for injection, and platinum chemotherapy (see Table 10 and Figure 1 ).

Patients were randomized to receive pemetrexed for injection with cisplatin or gemcitabine with cisplatin. Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS 0 versus 1), gender, disease stage, basis for pathological diagnosis (histopathological/cytopathological), history of brain metastases, and investigative center. Pemetrexed for Injection was administered intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m 2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 approximately 30 minutes after pemetrexed for injection administration on Day 1 of each cycle, gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1250 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and Day 8, and cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 approximately 30 minutes after administration of gemcitabine, on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment was administered up to a total of 6 cycles; patients in both arms received folic acid, vitamin B 12 , and dexamethasone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival. A total of 1725 patients were enrolled with 862 patients randomized to pemetrexed for injection in combination with cisplatin and 863 patients to gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin. The median age was 61 years (range 26-83 years), 70% were male, 78% were White, 17% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, and 2.1% were Black or African American, and <1% were other ethnicities. Among patients for whom ECOG PS (n=1722) and smoking history (n=1516) were collected, 65% had an ECOG PS of 1, 36% had an ECOG PS of 0, and 84% were smokers. For tumor characteristics, 73% had non-squamous NSCLC and 27% had squamous NSCLC; 76% had Stage IV disease. Among 1252 patients with non-squamous NSCLC histology, 68% had a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, 12% had large cell histology and 20% had other histologic subtypes. Efficacy results in Study JMDB are presented in Table 11 and Figure 2 .

These subgroup analyses are shown in Table 12 and Figures 3 and 4 . This difference in treatment effect for pemetrexed for injection based on histology demonstrating a lack of efficacy in squamous cell histology was also observed in Studies JMEN and JMEI.

Patients were randomized to receive pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 21 days or placebo until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients in both study arms received folic acid, vitamin B 12 , and dexamethasone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Randomization was carried out using a minimization approach [Pocock and Simon (1975)] using the following factors: gender, ECOG PS (0 versus 1), response to prior chemotherapy (complete or partial response versus stable disease), history of brain metastases (yes versus no), non-platinum component of induction therapy (docetaxel versus gemcitabine versus paclitaxel), and disease stage (IIIb versus IV). The major efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival based on assessment by independent review and overall survival; both were measured from the date of randomization in Study JMEN. A total of 663 patients were enrolled with 441 patients randomized to pemetrexed for injection and 222 patients randomized to placebo. The median age was 61 years (range 26-83 years); 73% were male; 65% were White, 32% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, and <2% were other ethnicities; 60% had an ECOG PS of 1; and 73% were current or former smokers. Median time from initiation of platinum-based chemotherapy to randomization was 3.3 months (range 1.6 to 5.1 months) and 49% of the population achieved a partial or complete response to first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy. With regard to tumor characteristics, 81% had Stage IV disease, 73% had non-squamous NSCLC and 27% had squamous NSCLC. Among the 481 patients with non-squamous NSCLC, 68% had adenocarcinoma, 4% had large cell, and 28% had other histologies. Efficacy results are presented in Table 13 and Figure 5 .

Patients were required to have an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized to receive pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 21 days or placebo until disease progression. Randomization was stratified by response to pemetrexed for injection in combination with cisplatin induction therapy (CR or PR versus SD), disease stage (IIIb versus IV), and ECOG PS (0 versus 1). Patients in both arms received folic acid, vitamin B 12 , and dexamethasone. The main efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and an additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS); PFS and OS were measured from the time of randomization. A total of 539 patients were enrolled with 359 patients randomized to pemetrexed for injection and 180 patients randomized to placebo. The median age was 61 years (range 32 to 83 years); 58% were male; 95% were White, 4.5% were Asian, and <1% were Black or African American; 67% had an ECOG PS of 1; 78% were current or former smokers; and 43% of the population achieved a partial or complete response to first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy. With regard to tumor characteristics, 91% had Stage IV disease, 87% had adenocarcinoma, 7% had large cell, and 6% had other histologies.

Patients were randomized to receive pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 intravenously or docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion once every 21 days. Patients randomized to pemetrexed for injection also received folic acid and vitamin B 12 . The study was designed to show that overall survival with pemetrexed for injection was non-inferior to docetaxel, as the major efficacy outcome measure, and that overall survival was superior for patients randomized to pemetrexed for injection compared to docetaxel, as a secondary outcome measure. A total of 571 patients were enrolled with 283 patients randomized to pemetrexed for injection and 288 patients randomized to docetaxel. The median age was 58 years (range 22 to 87 years); 72% were male; 71% were White, 24% were Asian, 2.8% were Black or African American, 1.8% were Hispanic or Latino, and <2% were other ethnicities; 88% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. With regard to tumor characteristics, 75% had Stage IV disease; 53% had adenocarcinoma, 30% had squamous histology; 8% large cell; and 9% had other histologic subtypes of NSCLC. The efficacy results in the overall population and in subgroup analyses based on histologic subtype are provided in Tables 16 and 17 , respectively. Study JMEI did not show an improvement in overall survival in the intent-to-treat population. In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of a treatment effect on survival in patients with squamous NSCLC; the absence of a treatment effect in patients with NSCLC of squamous histology was also observed Studies JMDB and JMEN [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] .

Patients were randomized (n=456) to receive pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 intravenously over 10 minutes followed 30 minutes later by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously over two hours on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle or to receive cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously over 2 hours on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; treatment continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The study was modified after randomization and treatment of 117 patients to require that all patients receive folic acid 350 mcg to 1000 mcg daily beginning 1 to 3 weeks prior to the first dose of pemetrexed for injection and continuing until 1 to 3 weeks after the last dose, vitamin B 12 1000 mcg intramuscularly 1 to 3 weeks prior to first dose of pemetrexed for injection and every 9 weeks thereafter, and dexamethasone 4 mg orally, twice daily, for 3 days starting the day prior to each pemetrexed for injection dose. Randomization was stratified by multiple baseline variables including KPS, histologic subtype (epithelial, mixed, sarcomatoid, other), and gender. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival and additional efficacy outcome measures were time to disease progression, overall response rate, and response duration. A total of 448 patients received at least one dose of protocol-specified therapy; 226 patients were randomized to and received at least one dose of pemetrexed for injection plus cisplatin, and 222 patients were randomized to and received cisplatin. Among the 226 patients who received cisplatin with pemetrexed for injection, 74% received full supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12 during study therapy, 14% were never supplemented, and 12% were partially supplemented. Across the study population, the median age was 61 years (range: 20 to 86 years); 81% were male; 92% were White, 5% were Hispanic or Latino, 3.1% were Asian, and <1% were other ethnicities; and 54% had a baseline KPS score of 90-100% and 46% had a KPS score of 70-80%. With regard to tumor characteristics, 46% had Stage IV disease, 31% Stage III, 15% Stage II, and 7% Stage I disease at baseline; the histologic subtype of mesothelioma was epithelial in 68% of patients, mixed in 16%, sarcomatoid in 10% and other histologic subtypes in 6%. The baseline demographics and tumor characteristics of the subgroup of fully supplemented patients was similar to the overall study population.The efficacy results from Study JMCH are summarized inTable 18 and Figure 9.

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: CLINICAL STUDIES A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of short-term prophylaxis with Cefoxitin for Injection in patients undergoing cesarean section who were at high risk for subsequent endometritis because of ruptured membranes. Patients were randomized to receive either three doses of placebo (n = 58), a single dose of Cefoxitin for Injection (2 g) followed by two doses of placebo (n = 64), or a three-dose regimen of Cefoxitin for Injection (each dose consisting of 2 g) (n = 60), given intravenously, usually beginning at the time of clamping of the umbilical cord, with the second and third doses given 4 and 8 hours post-operatively. Endometritis occurred in 16/58 (27.6%) patients given placebo, 5/63 (7.9%) patients given a single dose of Cefoxitin for Injection and 3/58 (5.2%) patients given three doses of Cefoxitin for Injection. The differences between the two groups treated with Cefoxitin for Injection and placebo with respect to endometritis were statistically significant (p < 0.01) in favor of Cefoxitin for Injection. The differences between the one-dose and three-dose regimens of Cefoxitin for Injection were not statistically significant. Two double-blind, randomized studies compared the efficacy of a single 2 gram intravenous dose of Cefoxitin for Injection to a single 2 gram intravenous dose of cefotetan in the prevention of surgical site-related infection (major morbidity) and non-site-related infections (minor morbidity) in patients following cesarean section. In the first study, 82/98 (83.7%) patients treated with Cefoxitin for Injection and 71/95 (74.7%) patients treated with cefotetan experienced no major or minor morbidity. The difference in the outcomes in this study (95% CI: –0.03, +0.21) was not statistically significant. In the second study, 65/75 (86.7%) patients treated with Cefoxitin for Injection and 62/76 (81.6%) patients treated with cefotetan experienced no major or minor morbidity. The difference in the outcomes in this study (95% CI: –0.08, +0.18) was not statistically significant. In clinical trials of patients with intra-abdominal infections due to Bacteroides fragilis group microorganisms, eradication rates at 1 to 2 weeks posttreatment for isolates were in the range of 70% to 80%.

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with chronic gout is derived from the published literature. Two randomized clinical trials assessed the efficacy of colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day for the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with gout initiating treatment with urate-lowering therapy. In both trials, treatment with colchicine decreased the frequency of gout flares. The efficacy of a low-dosage regimen of oral colchicine (colchicine total dose 1.8 mg over one hour) for treatment of gout flares was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, one week, dose-comparison study. Patients meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for gout were randomly assigned to three groups: high-dose colchicine (1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg hourly × 6 hours [4.8 mg total]); low-dose colchicine (1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg in one hour [1.8 mg total] followed by five placebo doses hourly); or placebo (two capsules, then one capsule hourly × six hours). Patients took the first dose within 12 hours of the onset of the flare and recorded pain intensity (11-point Likert scale) and adverse events over 72 hours. The efficacy of colchicine was measured based on response to treatment in the target joint, using patient self-assessment of pain at 24 hours following the time of first dose as recorded in the diary. A responder was one who achieved at least a 50% reduction in pain score at the 24-hour post dose assessment relative to the pretreatment score and did not use rescue medication prior to the actual time of 24-hour post dose assessment. Rates of response were similar for the recommended low-dose treatment group (38%) and the non-recommended high-dose group (33%) but were higher as compared to the placebo group (16%) as shown in Table 8 . Table 8. Number (%) of Responders Based on Target Joint Pain Score at 24 Hours Post First Dose Colchicine Dose Responders n (%) Placebo n (%) (n=58) % Differences in Proportion Low-Dose (n=74) High-Dose (n=52) Low-Dose vs Placebo (95% CI) High-Dose vs Placebo (95% CI) 28 (38%) 17 (33%) 9 (16%) 22 (8, 37) 17 (1, 33) Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients achieving varying degrees of improvement in pain from baseline at 24 hours. Figure 1 Pain Relief on Low and High Doses of Colchicine and Placebo (Cumulative) The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with FMF is derived from the published literature. Three randomized, placebo-controlled studies were identified. The three placebo-controlled studies randomized a total of 48 adult patients diagnosed with FMF and reported similar efficacy endpoints as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria. One of the studies randomized 15 patients with FMF to a six month crossover study during which five patients discontinued due to study noncompliance. The ten patients completing the study experienced five attacks over the course of 90 days while treated with colchicine compared to 59 attacks over the course of 90 days while treated with placebo. Similarly, the second study randomized 22 patients with FMF to a four month crossover study during which nine patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy while receiving placebo or study noncompliance. The 13 patients completing the study experienced 18 attacks over the course of 60 days while treated with colchicine compared to 68 attacks over the course of 60 days while treated with placebo. The third study was discontinued after an interim analysis of six of the 11 patients enrolled had completed the study; results could not be confirmed. Open-label experience with colchicine in adults and children with FMF is consistent with the randomized, controlled trial experience and was utilized to support information on the safety profile of colchicine and for dosing recommendations. 1\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis A total of 545 adults with cUTI, including pyelonephritis were randomized into a double-blind, double dummy, multi-center trial comparing VABOMERE (meropenem 2 grams and vaborbactam 2 grams) to piperacillin/tazobactam (piperacillin 4 grams/tazobactam 0.5 grams) intravenously every 8 hours. Switch to an oral antibacterial drug, such as levofloxacin was allowed after a minimum of 15 doses of IV therapy. The microbiologically modified intent to treat population (m-MITT) included all randomized patients who received any study drug and had at least 1 baseline uropathogen. Clinical and microbiological response at the end of IV treatment (EOIVT) required both a clinical outcome of cure or improvement and a microbiologic outcome of eradication (all baseline uropathogens at >10 5 CFU/mL are to be reduced to <10 4 CFU/mL). Clinical and microbiological response was also assessed at the Test of Cure (TOC) visit (approximately 7 days after completion of treatment) in the m-MITT population and required both a clinical outcome of cure and a microbiological outcome of eradication. Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups in the m-MITT population. Approximately 93% of patients were Caucasian and 66% were females in both treatment groups. The mean age was 54 years with 32% and 42% patients greater than 65 years of age in VABOMERE and piperacillin/tazobactam treatment groups, respectively. Mean body mass index was approximately 26.5 kg/m 2 in both treatment groups. Concomitant bacteremia was identified in 12 (6%) and 15 (8%) patients at baseline in VABOMERE and piperacillin/tazobactam treatment groups respectively. The proportion of patients with diabetes mellitus at baseline was 17% and 19% in VABOMERE and piperacillin/tazobactam treatment groups, respectively. The majority of patients (approximately 90%) were enrolled from Europe, and approximately 2% of patients were enrolled from North America. Overall, in both treatment groups, 59% of patients had pyelonephritis and 40% had cUTI, with 21% and 19% of patients having a non-removable and removable source of infection, respectively. Mean duration of IV treatment in both treatment groups was 8 days and mean total treatment duration (IV and oral) was 10 days; patients with baseline bacteremia could receive up to 14 days of therapy. Approximately 10% of patients in each treatment group in the m-MITT population had a levofloxacin-resistant pathogen at baseline and received levofloxacin as the oral switch therapy. This protocol violation may have impacted the assessment of the outcomes at the TOC visit. These patients were not excluded from the analysis presented in Table 6, as the decision to switch to oral levofloxacin was based on post-randomization factors. VABOMERE demonstrated efficacy with regard to clinical and microbiological response at the EOIVT visit and TOC visits in the m-MITT population as shown in Table 6.

In a subset of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, genotypic testing identified certain ESBL groups (e.g., TEM, CTX-M, SHV and OXA) in both treatment groups of the Phase 3 cUTI trial. The rates of clinical and microbiological response were similar in the ESBL-positive and ESBL-negative subset at EOIVT; at TOC, clinical and microbiological response was lower in the ESBL-positive as compared to ESBL-negative subset in both treatment groups.\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white. The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician's global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p<0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease. An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg mesalamine suppositories administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks. The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the mesalamine suppositories 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of mesalamine suppositories is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ].\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Two dose-response studies utilizing a once-daily regimen were conducted in 438 mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic. Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dosing. An antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was seen with 5 mg of lisinopril in some patients. However, in both studies blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with 10 mg, 20 mg or 80 mg of lisinopril than patients treated with 5 mg of lisinopril. In controlled clinical studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20 mg to 80 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg to 50 mg daily or atenolol 50 mg to 200 mg daily; and in other studies of patients with moderate to severe hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20 mg to 80 mg daily or metoprolol 100 mg to 200 mg daily. Lisinopril demonstrated superior reductions of systolic and diastolic compared to hydrochlorothiazide in a population that was 75% Caucasian. Lisinopril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure. Lisinopril had similar blood pressure reductions and adverse effects in younger and older (> 65 years) patients. It was less effective in reducing blood pressure in Blacks than in Caucasians. In hemodynamic studies of lisinopril in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large. In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in reducing blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Pediatric Patients: In a clinical study involving 115 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed < 50 kg received either 0.625 mg, 2.5 mg or 20 mg of lisinopril once daily and patients who weighed ≥ 50 kg received either 1.25 mg, 5 mg, or 40 mg of lisinopril once daily. At the end of 2 weeks, lisinopril lowered trough blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner with antihypertensive efficacy demonstrated at doses > 1.25 mg (0.02 mg per kg). This effect was confirmed in a randomized withdrawal phase, where the diastolic pressure rose by about 9 mmHg more in patients randomized to placebo than compared to patients who remained on the middle and high doses of lisinopril. The dose-dependent antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was consistent across several demographic subgroups: age, Tanner stage, gender, and race. In this study, lisinopril was generally well-tolerated. In the above pediatric studies, lisinopril was given either as tablets or in a suspension for those children and infants who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 14.2 Heart Failure In two placebo controlled, 12-week clinical studies compared the addition of lisinopril up to 20 mg daily to digitalis and diuretics alone. The combination of lisinopril, digitalis and diuretics reduced the following signs and symptoms of heart failure: edema, rales, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and jugular venous distention. In one of the studies, the combination of lisinopril, digitalis and diuretics reduced orthopnea, presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as NYHA Class III and IV; and improved exercise tolerance. A large (over 3000 patients) survival study, the ATLAS Trial, comparing 2.5 mg and 35 mg of lisinopril in patients with systolic heart failure, showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose. During baseline-controlled clinical trials, in patients with systolic heart failure receiving digitalis and diuretics, single doses of lisinopril resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and no change in heart rate. 14.3 Acute Myocardial Infarction The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienza nell’Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-3) study was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted in 19,394 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) admitted to a coronary care unit. It was designed to examine the effects of short-term (6 week) treatment with lisinopril, nitrates, their combination, or no therapy on short-term (6 week) mortality and on long-term death and markedly impaired cardiac function. Hemodynamically‑-stable patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms were randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, to six weeks of either 1) lisinopril alone (n=4841), 2) nitrates alone (n=4869), 3) lisinopril plus nitrates (n=4841), or 4) open control (n=4843). All patients received routine therapies, including thrombolytics (72%), aspirin (84%), and a beta blocker (31%), as appropriate, normally utilized in acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. The protocol excluded patients with hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg), severe heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2 mg per dL and/or proteinuria > 500 mg per 24 h). Patients randomized to lisinopril received 5 mg within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, 5 mg after 24 hours, and then 10 mg daily thereafter. Patients with systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg at baseline received 2.5 mg of lisinopril. If hypotension occurred, the lisinopril dose was reduced or if severe hypotension occurred lisinopril was stopped [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. The primary outcomes of the trial were the overall mortality at 6 weeks and a combined end point at 6 months after the myocardial infarction, consisting of the number of patients who died, had late (day 4) clinical congestive heart failure, or had extensive left ventricular damage defined as ejection fraction ≤ 35% or an akinetic-dyskinetic [A-D] score ≥ 45%. Patients receiving lisinopril (n=9646), alone or with nitrates, had an 11% lower risk of death (p=0.04) compared to patients who did not receive lisinopril (n=9672) (6.4% vs. 7.2%, respectively) at six weeks. Although patients randomized to receive lisinopril for up to six weeks also fared numerically better on the combined end point at 6 months, the open nature of the assessment of heart failure, substantial loss to follow-up echocardiography, and substantial excess use of lisinopril between 6 weeks and 6 months in the group randomized to 6 weeks of lisinopril, preclude any conclusion about this end point. Patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with lisinopril, had a higher (9.0% versus 3.7%) incidence of persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) and renal dysfunction (2.4% versus 1.1%) in-hospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg per dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].\n",

      "CLINICAL_TRIAL: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in patients ≥18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 patients who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 patients who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 patients who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Patients were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 patients with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were ≥18 years old and MTX naïve. Patients were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among patients enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3. Table 3. ACR Responses in Studies RA-II and RA-III (Percent of Patients) Study RA-II Monotherapy (26 weeks) Study RA-III Methotrexate Combination (24 and 52 weeks) Response Placebo Adalimumab Adalimumab Placebo/MTX Adalimumab/MTX 40 mg every 40 mg weekly 40 mg every other week other week N=110 N=113 N=103 N=200 N=207 ACR20 Month 6 19% 46% p<0.01, adalimumab vs. placebo 53% 30% 63% Month 12 NA NA NA 24% 59% ACR50 Month 6 8% 22% 35% 10% 39% Month 12 NA NA NA 10% 42% ACR70 Month 6 2% 12% 18% 3% 21% Month 12 NA NA NA 5% 23% The results of Study RA-I were similar to Study RA-III; patients receiving adalimumab 40 mg every other week in Study RA-I also achieved ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates of 65%, 52% and 24%, respectively, compared to placebo responses of 13%, 7% and 3% respectively, at 6 months (p<0.01). The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in Table 4. ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab patients receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of patients for up to 5 years with continuous adalimumab treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III. Table 4.

In Study RA-III, 85% of patients with ACR 20 responses at week 24 maintained the response at 52 weeks. The time course of ACR 20 response for Study RA-I and Study RA-II were similar. Figure 1. Study RA-III ACR 20 Responses over 52 Weeks In Study RA-IV, 53% of patients treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week plus standard of care had an ACR 20 response at week 24 compared to 35% on placebo plus standard of care (p<0.001). No unique adverse reactions related to the combination of adalimumab and other DMARDs were observed. In Study RA-V with MTX naïve patients with recent onset RA, the combination treatment with adalimumab plus MTX led to greater percentages of patients achieving ACR responses than either MTX monotherapy or adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table 5).

Figure 1. Study RA-III ACR 20 Responses over 52 Weeks Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6. Adalimumab/MTX treated patients demonstrated less radiographic progression than patients receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6. Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in Study RA-III Placebo/MTX Adalimumab/MTX 40 mg every other week Placebo/MTX-Adalimumab/ MTX (95% Confidence Interval 95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between MTX and adalimumab. ) P-value Based on rank analysis Total Sharp score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8) <0.001 Erosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) <0.001 JSN score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4) 0.002 In the open-label extension of Study RA-III, 77% of the original patients treated with any dose of adalimumab were evaluated radiographically at 2 years. Patients maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Patients had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7). Table 7. Radiographic Mean Change mean (95% confidence interval) in Study RA-V MTX p<0.001, adalimumab/MTX vs. MTX at 52 and 104 weeks and for adalimumab/MTX vs. adalimumab at 104 weeks N=257 Adalimumab p<0.01, for adalimumab/MTX vs. adalimumab at 52 weeks N=274 Adalimumab/MTX N=268 52 Weeks Total Sharp score 5.7 (4.2, 7.3) 3.0 (1.7, 4.3) 1.3 (0.5, 2.1) Erosion score 3.7 (2.7, 4.8) 1.7 (1.0, 2.4) 0.8 (0.4, 1.2) JSN score 2.0 (1.2, 2.8) 1.3 (0.5, 2.1) 0.5 (0.0, 1.0) 104 Weeks Total Sharp score 10.4 (7.7, 13.2) 5.5 (3.6, 7.4) 1.9 (0.9, 2.9) Erosion score 6.4 (4.6, 8.2) 3.0 (2.0, 4.0) 1.0 (0.4, 1.6) JSN score 4.1 (2.7, 5.4) 2.6 (1.5, 3.7) 0.9 (0.3, 1.5) Physical Function Response In studies RA-I through IV, adalimumab showed significantly greater improvement than placebo in the disability index of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) from baseline to the end of study, and significantly greater improvement than placebo in the health-outcomes as assessed by The Short Form Health Survey (SF 36). Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab patients and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) patients. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these patients maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of patients maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. 14.2 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (JIA-I and JIA-II) in patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the patients were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non- MTX-treated. All patients had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Patients who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the patients were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (≤0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Patients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of ≥30% from baseline in ≥3 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, ≥2 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, patients were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the patients in the MTX stratum and 74% of the patients in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer patients who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More patients treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to patients treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most patients (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most patients used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 14.3 Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in 413 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 patients enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult patients with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Patients on MTX therapy (158 of 313 patients) at enrollment (stable dose of ≤30 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 8 and 9). Among patients with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in patients with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few patients were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Patients with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of patients achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated patients demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated patients and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10). Table 10. Change in Modified Total Sharp Score in Psoriatic Arthritis Placebo N=141 Adalimumab N=133 Week 24 Week 24 Week 48 Baseline mean 22.1 23.4 23.4 Mean Change ± SD 0.9 ± 3.1 -0.1 ± 1.7 -0.2 ± 4.9 <0.001 for the difference between adalimumab, Week 48 and Placebo, Week 24 (primary analysis) Physical Function Response In Study PsA-I, physical function and disability were assessed using the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and the SF-36 Health Survey. Patients treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, patients treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to patients treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult patients in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as patients who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score ≥4 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain ≥ 40 mm, and (3) morning stiffness ≥ 1 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11. Responses of patients with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of patients receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of patients receiving placebo (p <0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in patients receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of patients treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to patients treated with placebo (6%).

Patients treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated patients at Week 24. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I 14.5 Adult Crohn’s Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, CD, (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker naïve patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 patients who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 patients with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Patients were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥70) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the patients were TNF blocker naïve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12). Table 12. Induction of Clinical Remission in Studies CD-I and CD-II (Percent of Patients) Clinical remission is CDAI score < 150; clinical response is decrease in CDAI of at least 70 points. CD-I CD-II Placebo N=74 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=76 Placebo N=166 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=159 Week 4 Clinical remission 12% 36% p<0.001 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions 7% 21% Clinical response 34% 58% p<0.01 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions 34% 52% Maintenance of Clinical Remission In Study CD-III at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the primary analysis. At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of patients who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to patients in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13. Maintenance of Clinical Remission in CD-III (Percent of Patients) Clinical remission is CDAI score < 150; clinical response is decrease in CDAI of at least 70 points. Placebo 40 mg Adalimumab every other week N=170 N=172 Week 26 Clinical remission 17% 40% p<0.001 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions Clinical response 28% 54% Week 56 Clinical remission 12% 36% Clinical response 18% 43% Of those in response at Week 4 who attained remission during the study, patients in the adalimumab every other week group maintained remission for a longer time than patients in the placebo maintenance group. Among patients who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Pediatric Crohn’s Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30). Enrolled patients had over the previous two year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Patients who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Patients received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (≥40 kg and <40 kg). Patients weighing ≥40 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Patients weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, patients within each body weight category (≥40 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for patients weighing ≥40 kg and 20 mg every other week for patients weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for patients weighing ≥40 kg and 10 mg every other week for patients weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage ≤40 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, patients who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of ≥ 15 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI > 30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of ≥ 15 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); patients who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of patients were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of patients were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 patients total, 188 patients completed the 4 week induction period, 152 patients completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of patients in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of patients in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of patients were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI ≤ 10). The proportions of patients in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI ≤ 10) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of patients in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group (Table 14). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg and 40 mg every other week for patients weighing ≥ 40 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Table 14. Clinical Remission and Clinical Response in Study PCD-I Low Maintenance Dose The low maintenance dose was 20 mg every other week for patients weighing ≥ 40 kg and 10 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg. (20 or 10 mg every other week) N = 95 High Maintenance Dose The high maintenance dose was 40 mg every other week for patients weighing ≥ 40 kg and 20 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg. (40 or 20 mg every other week) N = 93 Week 26 Clinical Remission Clinical remission defined as PCDAI ≤ 10. 28% 39% Clinical Response Clinical response defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline. 48% 59% Week 52 Clinical Remission 23% 33% Clinical Response 28% 42% 14.7 Adult Ulcerative Colitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 on a 12 point scale, with an endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 on a scale of 0 to 3) despite concurrent or prior treatment with immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, or 6-MP in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies UC-I and UC-II). Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker naïve patients, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of patients who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of patients enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, patients were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of patients received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score ≤ 2 with no individual subscores > 1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker naïve patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, patients in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 patients were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to patients treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to patients treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) (Table 15).
